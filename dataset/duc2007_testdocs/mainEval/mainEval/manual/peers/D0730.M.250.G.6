"I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending and I hope very much we can sustain it and we have to appeal it," Clinton told reporters as he was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the nation.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal spending and the balance of power in government.
The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress.
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.
Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, "It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court."
The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire measure.
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that "the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution."
