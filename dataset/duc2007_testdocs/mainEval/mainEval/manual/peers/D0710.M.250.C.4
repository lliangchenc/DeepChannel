The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region. Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel would do everything it could to bring about the repatriation of the two Mossad agents who were sentenced to three years in prison in Cyprus. Political observers here believed that the visit is a bridge- building act aimed to cement the Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by an espionage scandal. Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis jailed in Cyprus. Yediot Aharonot: -- Two agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were released by Cyprus on Thursday. The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
