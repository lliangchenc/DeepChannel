	   Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months with the military government over her right to travel freely within Myanmar, also known as Burma. _ Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover.	   ``Thailand is a democratic country and the military government in Burma killed many people in 1988.	   The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrests were an ``insulting act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma.'' Myanmar is also known as Burma.	   The protesters, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh over the years, waved placards that read ``We want restoration of democracy in Burma.'' 	   The demonstration was staged to mark the 10th anniversary of the seizure of power by military generals in Maynmar, formerly Burma.	   The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.    The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat. -- A total of 26 members of various anti-government armed groups surrendered to the Myanmar government in March, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
