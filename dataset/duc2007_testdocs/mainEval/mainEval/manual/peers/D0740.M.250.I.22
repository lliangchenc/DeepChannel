It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world. Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard Breitling Orbiter II. China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific. The Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft. Jones and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, who lifted off from the Swiss Alps on March 1, were over Belize in Central America this morning. Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment. The Breitling Orbiter balloon found strong winds at 34500 feet. They will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon. The crew's computers showed they traveled 29056 miles. The pair completed their circumnavigation on Saturday, crossing an invisible line in the air far above Mauritania. Wiley Post made a series of solo flights taking him completely around the world. Three Europeans set off Wednesday from Switzerland in the latest quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon. Fuel from the heating system had leaked into the cabin, according to a report by Swiss Radio International. The crew dropped ballast from their bright orange pressurized basket.
