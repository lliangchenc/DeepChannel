A governing party town councilor was killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.

The Basque Nationalist Party won 22 of the 75-seats in the 1994 ballot, has shared power with the Socialists who won 12 and the Basque Union.

A gang of hooded youths who support Basque separatism pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at a street fair in Bilbao, leaving 17 people injured.

The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's Basque conflict and the international community, particularly the United States, has a duty to help bring this about, Irish republican leader Gerry Adams said Monday.

Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is considering paying damages to relatives of people killed by government-backed death squads that targeted Basque separatists in the 1980s when his Socialist predecessors were in power.

Its bombings and shootings in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain have left nearly 800 people dead since 1968.

A former leader of the Basque separatist group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace talks.

One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.

A bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque separatists.
