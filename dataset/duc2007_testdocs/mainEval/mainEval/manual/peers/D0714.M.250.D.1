Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter the music-swapping site from their computer networks. 

Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week that they, too, will not block access to Napster. 

A lawyer for the rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre asked several elite colleges this month to ban Napster, which allows visitors to its Web site to obtain copyrighted music for free. Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E. King, would make a college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property.'' 

But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are more important than the threat of copyright infringement. 

``MIT has a long history of providing its faculty, staff, and students with uncensored access to the Internet,'' said James D. Bruce, MIT's vice president for information systems, in a letter to King. 

Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of recordings. 

Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment industry.
