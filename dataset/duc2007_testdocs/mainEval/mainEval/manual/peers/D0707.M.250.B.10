In any case, the report indicated Turkish membership would not come soon. The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides. The u.s. government said today that the European Union should accept Turkey as its new member in the future. The 15-nation eu rejected a membership of Turkey. Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, signed an agreement on Customs Union with the eu in 1996 and has been seeking an eu membership. Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union, which confirmed the perspective of Turkey's full membership to the group. She said her country would make new efforts toward full eu membership. Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a nato member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the eu, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the eu. Turkey currently has a customs union agreement with the eu, which removed some trade barriers. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey's ties with the eu. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's efforts for eu membership, but the charge is rejected by Athens. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union membership.
