 Tokyo will appreciate Pakistan if it takes the initiative to show adherence to the non-proliferation treaty. India has spurned both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to give up their nuclear arsenals. Sharif's comments came. It is precisely in this capacity that we urge these countries to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The draft resolution urges both countries to halt the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and calls on them to sign nuclear arms control treaties. It is the first press conference given by the prime minister since India conducted a series of nuclear tests. India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests that drew international condemnation. Summoning Pakistani Ambassador Arif Ayub the Italian Foreign Ministry voiced concerns over the Pakistani tests, adding that India and Pakistan should start talks and solve conflicts with the help of the international communities. Pakistan, in response exploded five nuclear devices claiming the tests were done for the sake of national security. The Washington Post quoted some US officials as saying that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province. The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its security.
