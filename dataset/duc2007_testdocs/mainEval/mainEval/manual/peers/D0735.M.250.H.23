A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and Yellowstone.  Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an ``experimental and nonessential'' wolf population, which means they lost much of the protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species Act.

The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.  They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock.

If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.  After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass.
