The group had received an anonymous letter threatening ``to kill any wolf reintroduced.'' Four days later, someone spray-painted in large letters, ``Wolves'' and ``N.M. Needs Wolves'' on the building that houses the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association.
On Wednesday, the Cattle Growers' Association sent out a press release urging hunters to boycott a Fish and Wildlife Service questionnaire about the wolf killings.
Slipping into the kind of harsh language that often has surrounded the wolf program, the association called the query ``Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised reintroduction program.''
The federal and state wolf program has changed its approach in its second year after criticism from ranchers and other local residents.
Most of the release sites will now be more remote, there will be more law enforcement agents in the areas and there will be a greater effort to alert residents, forest users and groups such as hunters' organizations.
Of the animals released in 1998, one wolf is missing and presumed dead, and three other females were returned to captivity.
So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a current population.
Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
