The administration has said it will not decide until 2000 on firm plans for an anti-missile system. The figure covers the building and operating of the system for its expected life of 20 years. U.s. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar national missile defense system, but Washington has not yet approved its deployment. Labor is opposed to Australian participation in the scheme. The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads. Critics of the system argue that the program would increase Britain's vulnerability to attack without offering coverage by the u.s. defensive screen. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the Pentagon office in charge of the program, said preliminary indications are that the prototype radar successfully distinguished among the 20 objects in space. His decision effectively ended missile defense supporters' hope of having a system ready for use by 2005. The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies. The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005 _ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures. As a result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until before Clinton decides whether to approve the system. Russia has deployed its system around Moscow. But that program has experienced four successive failures.
