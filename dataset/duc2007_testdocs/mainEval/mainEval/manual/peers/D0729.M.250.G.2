Randy Weaver will be in the co-pilot's seat of Gritz' Gritz' Cessna today when it touches down in Andrews, N. C., where the friends--one a separatist and the other the highest decorated Green Beret commander from the Vietnam war--will undertake their mission to hopefully escort Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph out of the mountains and down a safe corridor through the federal justice system. After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday. During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub. Investigators said tests conducted at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) lab in Atlanta has detected dynamite residue in both trucks--one was his and one he allegedly stole--that Rudolph has driven since the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in Birmingham. An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles''
