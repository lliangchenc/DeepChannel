TEHRAN, March 11 - Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries. He said that Khomeini did not mean the death sentence to be a command. Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations. On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses", and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence. However, Iranian authorities have given into tremendous pressures from the European Union after the death of Khomeini, promising not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie. LIEGE, Belgium - Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him. Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream opposition within Iran.
