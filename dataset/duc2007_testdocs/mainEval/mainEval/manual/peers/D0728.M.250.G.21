	   A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at the effects of the drug 3TC on people with long-standing infections with the virus.	   Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects.Food and Drug Administration approved a new approach, a combination of interferon and ribavirin. 	The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination   of interferon and ribavirin.Food and Drug Administration approved use of another drug, ribavirin, which in combination with interferon boosts recovery rates to 40 percent.She also has been taking a pill that may be a drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of interferon and double its cure rate.The best interferon produced by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b, which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect cultured cells against a mouse virus.    In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.    In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.    Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
