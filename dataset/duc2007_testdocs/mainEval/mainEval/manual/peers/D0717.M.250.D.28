The manufacturer of the diet drug combination fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and often-fatal lung problems. 
The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Pondimin was made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and marketed by American Home.
Another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage.
The first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen has ended in a reported $500,000 settlement for a woman who used the diet drug combination. 
Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits.
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet drug combination.
American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit. American Home reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen.
Officials with American Home Products, the drug company, declined to comment.
