In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned his two children the following day. Mark Barton, the 44-year-old day trader at the center of Thursday's bloody rampage, was described by neighbors in the Atlanta suburb of Morrow as a quiet, churchgoing man who worked all day on his computer. Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said. Authorities are grimly piecing together what they know about Mark O Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and killed nine people. Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000. The frustrated chemist-turned-day trader killed himself the night of the multiple murders after two officers surrounded his minivan at an Acworth gas station. As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history. What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader'' How difficult is day-trading.
