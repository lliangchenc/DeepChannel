"Tom Campbell has won elections," said Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. Fong said Feinstein's GOP opponent in 1995, former Rep. Michael Huffington. 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein still couldn't find the magic language. After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to bring up her censure resolution. As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate. Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National Mall in support of gun control. "I intend to be (a) United States senator." Feinstein was courted as a potential running mate by Vice-President Walter Mondale in 1984. Coverdell acknowledged that Congress won't repeal the certification of Mexico this year. This was Sen. Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the president's address. Feinstein, D-Calif., has issued no public statement since. Feinstein's gun-licensing legislation is her top priority. Large fund-raising events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles. The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks before California's March primary, when Feinstein had 54 percent to Campbell's 36 She voted against NAFTA one of the administration's major accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The 1995 flag amendment passed the House by a 312-120 vote before failing in the Senate. Feinstein's time has been spent. It's the future of the American presidency too."
