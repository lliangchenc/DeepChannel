He subsequently succeeded in developing recombinant a-1b interferon -- the first interferon expressed by a gene isolated from healthy Chinese leukocyte cells. About half do not respond to interferon at all. She also has been taking a pill that may be a drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of interferon and double its cure rate. Until recently, interferon was the only treatment. Most patients treated with interferon eventually relapse. A drug called interferon helps in 40 percent of cases, but the benefits are short-lived. The best interferon produced by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b, which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect cultured cells against a mouse virus. For the time being interferon is the only treatment. The expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to patients who had not taken interferon. But because Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another company. In its ruling delivered to Serono, in March 1999, and disclosed, the FDA said Biogen maintains the exclusive right to sell beta interferon in the United States until 2003 under the Orphan Drug Act, a law that grants marketing exclusivity to companies that develop drugs for certain, rare diseases, including multiple sclerosis. The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
