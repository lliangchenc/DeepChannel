By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion. Most of it has been joint ventures: the ice cream with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola; and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft Foods Inc. Starbucks has tapped the Pepsi-Cola Co's ``ubiquitous distribution power'' to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee beverage which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said Schultz. ``It's destruction of individual choice, and it takes the fun out of it if every coffee shop is the same'' With the purchase of Pasqua, Starbucks will inherit a small chain that had $26 million in revenue last year, adding to an empire that had sales of $13 billion by comparison. A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmocom _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company. The New York Times Co and Starbucks Coffee Co said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times' advertising promotion of Starbucks. Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced Tuesday that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount. Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks.
