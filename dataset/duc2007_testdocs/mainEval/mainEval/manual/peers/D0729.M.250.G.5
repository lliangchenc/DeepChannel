A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals. Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning. Doug Jones, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and the death penalty. - The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a manhunt for more than two years. Agents have said they want to question Rudolph in those bombings and that they are in no hurry to charge him in the Atlanta cases, because they have a warrant for him in the Jan. 29 bombing in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse. The discovery of a pickup truck believed stolen by Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has led federal investigators to double their force here and hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive who was last reported seen Jan. 30.
