Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the standards, which are expected to go into effect later this year, will be the ''most comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world'' The rules will allow products that meet the standards to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic'' USDA first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the organic industry strongly objected to provisions that could have allowed the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, as well as genetically engineered and irradiated ingredients. Products grown and processed according to the standards and contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic'' Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made with'' organic ingredients. Consumers who don't want to eat biotech food are expected to provide a boost to the $6 billion-a-year organic industry. Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with great potential. When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic. In a reversal, the government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday.
