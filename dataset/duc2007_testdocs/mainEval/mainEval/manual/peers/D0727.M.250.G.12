ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final. In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce. She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has already transferred. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money. The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after 1998 GOP election losses.
