The suspects allegedly gave to Mossad. Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974. Their arrest soured relations between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an Israeli head of state. In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts that the two were working for the Mossad secret service. Israel has not denied the men. Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis are Mossad agents. In September 1997, Israeli Mossad agents were caught in Jordan. A senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus. Its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel. Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Tuesday indicated that he is not considering release of two Israeli agents. The coming visit is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip to Cyprus in November 1998. Israel won't harm Cyprus. His Israeli counterpart had come to see him twice about the case. Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi.
