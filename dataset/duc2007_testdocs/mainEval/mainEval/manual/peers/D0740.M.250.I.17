It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world. The balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific. It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific. The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan, on March 11, 1999, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week. Only last week a British balloon, the Cable& Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean. Prospects for a quick Atlantic crossing -- the team hopes to make it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey, in March 1999, or early -- picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found strong winds at 34,500 feet. After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt smoothly. The International Olympic Committee said that they will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon.
