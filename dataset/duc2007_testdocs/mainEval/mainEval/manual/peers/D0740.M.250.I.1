An Arizona man trying to become the first solo balloonist to complete a nonstop trip around the world was speeding over India Thursday, hoping to steer clear of the Himalayas. 

The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through his journey, which began in Rockford, Ill., on Feb. 22. After some slow going in the early days of the flight, Uliassi's balloon, the J. Renee, found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100 miles an hour, said Scott Lorenz, a spokesman. 

``The plan is to fly south of the Himalayas,'' Lorenz said from the mission's headquarters in Homewood, Ill., near Chicago. ``Right now it looks like he'll be able to do that.'' Uliassi was flying at 31,000 feet, not much higher than Mt. Everest, and was anticipating thunderstorms. 

Uliassi has permission to fly over China, which he is expected to do in the next several days before heading out over the Pacific. He packed enough fuel for about 20 days, Lorenz said, and thinks he has enough to complete his trip. 

Should Uliassi do so, landing east of Rockford, he would be the third balloonist to circumnavigate the world nonstop. The first two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain, completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian desert. 

Like those two, Uliassi is flying a hybrid balloon called a Rozier type, which uses two huge sealed nylon bags, one containing helium and the other air.
