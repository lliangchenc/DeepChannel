    The information will be compiled from the reports of wildlife managers in the various units, who work the field in those areas.    Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of self-defense.    Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter _ perhaps as many as 17.    About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots.Bass does note that each rancher losing any of his herd will be compensated and that the losses would surely be minimal.    Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
