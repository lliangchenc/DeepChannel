Gore has previously won the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, as well as state Democratic U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, Howard Berman of Mission Hills, Cal Dooly of Hanford, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Matthew Martinez of Alhambra, Juanita Millender-McDonald of Torrance, Grace Napolitano of Norwalk and Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles.
Feinstein has long expressed her support of Gore's 2000 presidential bid, but made her endorsement formal Wednesday.
``Vice President Al Gore has demonstrated time and time again he is dedicated to the people of the United States _ be it reducing gun violence, protecting our environment, bolstering patients rights, safeguarding a woman's right to choose or reforming public education,'' said Feinstein in a statement released Wednesday.
Jeff Woodburn, the outgoing state party chairman in New Hampshire, site of the first primary, and a Gore supporter said: ``His biggest negative, especially running in the small, early states, could be his person-to-person approach.''
In addition, Gore could find that many voters, including Democrats, are turned off by a candidate aligned so closely to a president who has encountered so many personal difficulties.
``I am certain that in a country of 250 million, somebody would say that,'' Smith said.
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., on Friday endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
Kennedy chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm of House Democrats.
