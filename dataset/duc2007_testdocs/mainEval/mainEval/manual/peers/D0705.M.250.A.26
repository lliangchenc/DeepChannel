Credited with encouraging the armed Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce has already been sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations. ETA began an indefinite and condition-free cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern France.
