In reaction to Pakistan's nuclear tests, Egypt, in May 1998, underscored the need to make the Middle East a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . More countries have come out to condemn Pakistan's nuclear tests. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released, "We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia, in July 1998, repeated its call to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Pakistan's scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said here, in September 1998, that no clause of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will affect Pakistan's nuclear capability. Japan, in February 1999, urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before India, saying it would boost the image of Pakistan in the international community. Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear facilities to international inspection.
