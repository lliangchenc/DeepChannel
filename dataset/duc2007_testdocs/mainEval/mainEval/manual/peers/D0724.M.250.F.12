The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it demands urgent attention by medical professionals, the government and the public. ``We're the fattest we've ever been,'' said Sachiko Tokunaga de St. Jeor, director of the nutrition research and education program at the University of Nevada. The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55 percent today. The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and treatment. We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables we eat are french fries. More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent _ are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent of adults who are obese, CDC said. From 1991 to 1998, the proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal body weight doubled. Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as smoking
