Simpson, 53, has had custody of his children for four years, since shortly after he was acquitted of murdering their mother - his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson - and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson said he's in the middle of moving from Los Angeles to South Florida, renting a house for now in an undisclosed location. Bailey said Friday, during testimony in a Florida courtroom where his license to practice law is being challenged, that shortly after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense attorney Robert Shapiro. Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too emotional a time for Simpson. In the civil case against Simpson, lawyers for the Goldman family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after the slayings. Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned. The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's business.
