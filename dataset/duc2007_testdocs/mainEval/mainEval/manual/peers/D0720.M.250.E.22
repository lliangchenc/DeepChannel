Under the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed to pullback from of Hebron by March 28. Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo accords. Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed last January, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year. Israel will scuttle the Oslo accords if Arafat declares independence. Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians. The two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. More Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years since Oslo. The five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords. Under the Oslo principles, he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date. Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment. Netanyahu has admitted that he ignores the Oslo accords. Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
