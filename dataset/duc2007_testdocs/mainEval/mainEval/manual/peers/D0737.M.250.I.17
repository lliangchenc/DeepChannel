Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited. In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes, possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road. China has explored the international seabed since the late 1970s COMRRDA registration with the United Nations as a pioneer investor in international seabed resources in 1991 raised the country's exploration program to a new stage. China has announced it is to draw up boundaries for its exclusive mineral mining operations in 75,000 square kilometers of the eastern section of the Pacific Ocean where it intends to intensify its exploration activities. Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships -- the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic. Oil companies operating in Nigeria have achieved encouraging results in deep water oil exploration although a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars was spent between 1993 and 1998. The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country's deep water terrain could hold the key to meeting the government's set target of increasing daily crude oil production to four barrels per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of 2010.
