LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson has lost a bid to block broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense team secrets to an audience of millions. 

After reading the script, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe refused to issue a preliminary injunction Wednesday. The judge said he was unconvinced the broadcast of ''American Tragedy'' would harm Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996 best-selling book on which it is based. 

''There's just no necessity'' for an injunction, the judge said, noting that Simpson can collect damages later if he wins his lawsuit claiming Lawrence Schiller, who co-wrote the book and directed the miniseries, and Robert Kardashian, Simpson's former defense lawyer, violated privacy contracts and published confidential material. 

''We're very pleased, of course,'' said Gary Bostwick, a lawyer representing Project 95, the movie's producer, and Schiller. 

Simpson lawyer Terry Gross of San Francisco said an appeal was being considered. 

However, both sides admit they are unlikely to get an appeal judgment before the miniseries' Nov. 12 air date. No trial date has been set for the lawsuit. 

Like the book, the miniseries focuses on the tensions and strategies of the legal ''dream team'' that won Simpson's acquittal in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was found liable for the killings in a later civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
