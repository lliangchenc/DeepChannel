 The earthquake that struck western   Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a  leading geologist said Sunday. 
 	He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire   factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have  been left largely undamaged. 
 	Meanwhile, eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor   reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said  they still held out hopes  though slim  that more people could be  found alive.The quake virtually leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western Turkey.Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in Turkey since 1971. ``I have walked just about every foot of that fault zone,'' he said.    Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once every two years. Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey in the early hours of August 17.  The death toll in the monster earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting. Izmit, also called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the 7.4-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17, killing over 14,000 people and injuring over 27,000 others. Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
