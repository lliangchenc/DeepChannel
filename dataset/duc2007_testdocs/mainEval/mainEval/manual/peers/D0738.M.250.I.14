The following are major economic news briefs from Latin America over the past few days: The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and to the investments that were made during the past two years in the mining industry, mainly in the north of the country. Peru's mining production is expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said today. Argentina will be among the top 20 gold producers in the world, a senior official of the Argentine Ministry of Mines said Wednesday. But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America. Peru is the world's 12th biggest gold producer and second in South America after Brazil. A rich gold seam with estimated reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru. Peru, with its resurgent gold industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries, according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to Thailand. Foreign mining firms will maintain investments in Chile of 1.66 billion U.S. dollars this year at the same level as last year.
