In 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national defense against such missiles. Tests can determine whether a credible defense system can be build. Britain should push the United States to halt plans for its national missile defense system. In the second test, conducted about two hours after the first, also involved a Minuteman III missile. The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, was done at White Sands Missile Range. A US prototype missile interceptor streaked into space on Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead but failed to hit the target. It will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile. No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests. A six-month study of BMD programs led by US Defense Undersecretary Paul Kaminski. The United States should develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. The THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range. The missile lost control shortly after launch. The interceptor missile was launched from a US Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands after the target missile.
