Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast. 
When the population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction. 
The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. 
A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing incomprehensible, and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of returning 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade _ will continue. 
Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves. 
Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter _ perhaps as many as 17. 
It noted that any reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably spread into New Brunswick. 
A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and Yellowstone. 
The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy.
