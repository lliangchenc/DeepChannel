John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane. Kennedy Jr. knew where he was going. A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late, in July 1999, off the Massachusetts coast, and the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said. John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up to the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck. However authorities have acknowledged they may never find the reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law. A tribute to founder John F. Kennedy Jr. -- is without a celebrity cover for the first time.
