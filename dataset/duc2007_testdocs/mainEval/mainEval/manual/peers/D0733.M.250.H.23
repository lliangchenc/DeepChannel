To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program to show teachers how to use its collection in their [American] classrooms.  The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its [Library of Congress site] potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.  In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to start building a national library without walls.  The $13 million in donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.

In a letter in response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the many materials that it presents to the public.''  Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress, said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances.
