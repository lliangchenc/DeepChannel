In a press briefing here, in March 1998, Colonel Kyaw Thein, head of the Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry, said the terrorist group, led by Ko Thein of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front, plotted to launch bomb attacks against some civilian targets. The SLORC -- State Law and Order Restoration Council -- which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat. Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, in September 1998, to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover. Myanmar is also known as Burma. Much of our energy at the State Department is spent encouraging foreign governments to act for what we perceive to be the common good -- dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and advocating the development of democratic practices and institutions. A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma. The students fled Burma after the military coup in 1988 and have been refugees in Thailand for more than a decade. The report, required by Congress, updates a 1998 review of labor conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which reached similar conclusions.
