In findings that will dismay some arts advocates, a Harvard study released Wednesday casts doubt on the link between the arts and academic achievement. 

In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests. 

``We're not saying don't use the arts in presenting other topics,'' said study co-author Lois Hetland, a psychologist affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Education. ``We're saying don't risk putting all your eggs in the basket that art will raise math scores, because the evidence is not strong enough to support that argument.'' 

But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the connection between music and thinking defies measurement. 

``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create different perceptions and sensations within different regions of the brain,'' Campbell said. ``The Mozart effect is far more than any one study can measure.'' 

The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago. In that study, a small group of college students did better on certain spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.
