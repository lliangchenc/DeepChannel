_ An international meeting Thursday on India's nuclear rivalry with neighboring Pakistan likely means that the world's five original nuclear powers will address the main dispute between the two countries: Kashmir. _ The five longstanding nuclear states refused Thursday to admit India or Pakistan into the nuclear club and called on them to refrain from further nuclear tests and resolve their differences with direct talks.	   In rejecting the South Asian nations' bid to join the ranks of nuclear powers, the five nations said after a two-hour meeting: 	   ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.'' 	   India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them, the communique said. He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday, "We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." -- In reaction to Pakistan's nuclear tests, Egypt Thursday underscored the need to make the Middle East a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
