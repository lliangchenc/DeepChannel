It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
Only last week a British balloon, the Cable Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
Worst of all, some of the nations along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to balloons and had to be avoided.
Prospects for a quick Atlantic crossing -- the team hopes to make it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey by Saturday or early Sunday -- picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found strong winds at 34,500 feet.
Near exhaustion on the 20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of miles farther to a more dramatic landing near the pyramids in Egypt.
There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon designs.
The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21, has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane, which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever
