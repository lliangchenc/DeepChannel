In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited dozens of states to rally support for his statehood proclamation, but many states urged him to hold off the unilateral move on May 4 to avert being exploited by hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming elections. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa reaffirmed Sunday that Egypt opposes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin's proposal for holding a Madrid II international conference on the Mideast peace process. In a stern warning to Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the intifada (uprising) if the peace process collapses. The process, which has borne fruits including the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza Strip and West Bank, received a severe blow when the hardline Likud government came to power in Israel last year. By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process. Egypt today gave Israel three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians, otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic summit due to be held in Cairo
