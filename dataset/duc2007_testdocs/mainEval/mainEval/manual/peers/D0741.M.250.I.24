Before he killed his wife with a hammer.. Barton killed his two children, Matthew and Mychelle, the next evening. Ginger Lewis, Leigh Ann Barton's cousin, said the whole family was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey. In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge apartment. 

In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings. After the shootings, Barton shot himself to death in his minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth, just north of Atlanta. The bodies of Barton's wife and children were found at about 3:30 p.m. that day, shortly after he had finished his shooting spree in Atlanta's Buckhead financial and entertainment district. There was evidence the nation was still focused on Mark O. Barton's shooting spree Thursday at two Buckhead office buildings, where he left nine dead and 12 injured. 

From the time their bodies were found, Barton was the prime suspect. The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader. 

Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was a regular. The service was organized by Dr. Gulshan Harjee, whose husband was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech
