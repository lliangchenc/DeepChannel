More than 1,000 relief workers from 19 countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations. Local private NTV Saturday quoted the experts as saying that the economic loss caused by the killer earthquake also accounts for half of Turkey's domestic debt of 40 billion dollars. A team of US engineering experts was in the region surveying the damage to make recommendations on how Turkey can house people, given constraints of time and money. Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the history of Turkey has caused''. A state minister and government spokesman, Sukru Sina Gurel, said last week that Turkey planned to provide free housing to those who had lost their homes, but added that it would be more than a year before everyone was permanently rehoused. Izmit, also called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the 74-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17, killing over 14,000 people and injuring over 27,000 others. In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related diseases surpassed 4,100. Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
