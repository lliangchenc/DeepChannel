The Yellowstone wolves generally have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population. If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas. 

The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal ''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West. The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program. The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves. 

Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today WED. Inside was one of two endangered Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and Gila national forests. Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast. A wildlife activist had met with an Arizona prisoner who said he had been offered $35,000 by a New Mexico rancher to kill all wolves reintroduced into the wild.
