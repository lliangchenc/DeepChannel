Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother's parents.
Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against his former friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian, and author Lawrence Schiller, whose 1996 book "American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense" is the basis of the series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable in a subsequent civil trial for the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J.Simpson's acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral emotions?
In reply to the lawsuit, Schiller and Kardashian denied making any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
