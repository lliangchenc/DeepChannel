"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said, referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
Despite its compliant over the Luxembourg decision, Turkey has made it very clear that it would continue to develop economic cooperation with the 15 EU nations.
The EU is the largest trade partner of Turkey with traditional links.
When Javier Solana, commissioner for EU foreign and security affairs, visited Ankara early this month, Turkey voiced objections to the ESDI on the grounds that non-EU members, like itself, would be excluded.
Turkey insisted that it wants to be involved in the decision- making, rather than the decision-implementing, process.
Turkey had also sent a diplomatic note of warning at the end of May to 11 EU countries which are also NATO members over their approach to the ESDI.
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey's concern, Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by the Western European Union, the EU's military body.
In a press statement issued following his meeting with Solana, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey will not support the enlargement of the NATO because the EU does not admit Turkey into the regional alliance.
Demirel said, "Although we are for the enlargement of the NATO in principle, we think that it is important for this issue to be evaluated within the general framework of European new formation."
