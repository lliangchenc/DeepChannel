TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Some 97 million American adults, or 55 percent, are considered overweight or obese. 

According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs nearly $100 billion annually. That includes costs for weight loss treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by obesity. 

Overweight people are at increased risk of illness from: 

-high blood pressure and other heart disease, 

-adult-onset diabetes, 

-stroke, 

-gallbladder disease, 

-osteoarthritis, 

-certain cancers, 

-lipid disorders, 

-respiratory problems and 

-sleep apnea, a disorder that primarily strikes overweight men, causing them to repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping. Besides causing fatigue, it decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain. 

NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive abdominal fat - meaning a waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women - and people with a body mass index of 25 or more. 

Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight - roughly 221 pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.
