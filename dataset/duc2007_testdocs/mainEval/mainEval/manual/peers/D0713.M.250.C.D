Pakistan has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), citing its need to maintain a credible nuclear deterrence against aggression from India.  It has asserted it would take appropriate steps to safeguard its national security, while maintaining a policy of restraint regarding its nuclear capabilities.  

Following India's nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, 1998, Pakistan felt compelled to respond with six of its own -- five on May 28 and one on May 30.  It asserted the tests were meant to correct the strategic imbalance caused by India's.  

International reaction deplored Pakistan's nuclear tests and called for it to sign the NPT.  The UN, NATO and OAS urged restraint and halting nuclear testing.  Many nations, including the US, Britain, Japan and the EU imposed economic and military sanctions.    

British, Chinese, French, Russian and US diplomats met to discuss the escalating South Asian arms race.  They issued a joint communiqué calling on Pakistan and India to halt testing, resolve their differences and avoid provocative acts, and cautioning them not to export nuclear equipment, materials or technology.  

Pakistan claimed the international reaction proved a double standard existed and its legitimate security needs continued to be ignored.  It refused to give up its nuclear option, but did offer to begin dialogue with India.  In September 1998, Pakistan announced it had achieved its objectives and declared a moratorium on nuclear tests. It agreed to adhere to the NPT only if India was forced to do the same and international sanctions were lifted.
