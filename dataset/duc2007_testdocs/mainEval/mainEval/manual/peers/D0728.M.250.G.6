In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in the "863" plan.
He discovered for the first time that the white blood cells of Chinese people, when attacked by viruses, will produce "a 1" type instead of "a 2" type interferons.
He subsequently succeeded in developing recombinant a-1b interferon -- the first interferon expressed by a gene isolated from healthy Chinese leukocyte cells.
The mail-order pharmacy is offering the anti-viral drug at $1.25 per 200-mg capsule.
That works out to about one-fifth the cost of the same drug obtained in the Schering-Plough combination kit.
Consalvo said the drugmaker has no plans to change its marketing practices or prices.
Serono executives have argued that stronger doses of beta interferon work better for patients with more advanced multiple sclerosis.
Its research, however, did not include head-to-head trials comparing Avonex and Rebif.
``Serono will continue its discussions with the FDA on the outstanding orphan drug issues to determine how it can make Rebif available to MS patients as soon as possible,'' said Hisham Samra, Serono Laboratories' president.
The key drug involved -- known as ribavirin -- has not been approved for official use in Canada, but it is available throughout the country.
