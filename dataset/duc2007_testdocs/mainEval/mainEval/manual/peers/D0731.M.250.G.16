Tripp's decision to give Starr tapes spurring eight-month investigation likely to lead to 
hearings on impeachment . . . Anyone think of principled justification for releasing 
videotape of president not audio tape of Linda Tripp . . . Drive to nearest food pantry, 
unemployment office or under-equipped public school and explaining to people why 
Starr investigation important . . . Court hearing conducted for week to determine if 
Maryland authorities having sufficient grounds to put Tripp on trial . . . Democrats on 
Hyde's committee questioned whether real Republican motive to withhold evidence 
damaging to Tripp's motives and methods . . . Publicized violation to have weakened 
statute's deterrent value and making harder for state to justify prosecutions of less 
notorious violations in future . . . Tripp investigated by Maryland grand jury for allegedly 
violating state law requiring parties to conversation to consent to taping . . . Best interest 
and making very sad . . . Guilty of felonious audacity for making that just like . . . 
Lewinsky telling grand jury as finishing testimony . . .
