The conference is sponsored by the China Society for Library Science, the National Library of China, the American Library Association, the Chinese American Librarians Association, the Library of Congress, and the US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. David Schwartz, a researcher of the university's school of business administration, compared materials on various subjects found in the world's three major libraries, the U.S. Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the British Royal Library, to Internet researches he carried out on the same topics. The Library of Congress, the world's most voluminous library, grew by the equivalent of 2 million books on a single day last week. In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to start building a national library without walls. Jones and his wife, Gene, gave the money to the Library of Congress to replace volumes in the third president's personal library that were destroyed in a fire in the Capitol in 1851. The Library of Congress was first housed in the Capitol; Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress, said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances. The Library of Congress is charged with collecting the creative work of the American people. Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving the nation's heritage.
