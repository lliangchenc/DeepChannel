Worried that its leading enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed to build a nuclear bomb. The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials, although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several years away from having devices that work. During Adamov's visit to Tehran, the two countries signed an agreement to accelerate the construction of a nuclear reactor in Bushehr and contemplate possible cooperation in building more nuclear power stations in Iran. Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf. Under the Israeli pressure, the US Congress is considering to impose sanctions against Russian companies reportedly involved in transferring nuclear and missile technologies to Iran. Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed to be years away from building and testing such a weapon. It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons, Nouri said.
