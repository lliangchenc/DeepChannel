Before savagely beating Matthew Shepard with a pistol butt, one of his tormentors taunted him, saying, "It's Gay Awareness Week," a police investigator has testified at a hearing in Laramie, Wyo., for one of two men accused of the murder of the gay college student. Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago. A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they "gravely injured" the defendant's right to a fair trial. Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said, in October 1999, as his trial began. Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in "a five-minute emotional rage" because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury as his murder trial began here. Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a drunken, drug-induced rage. A man testified he was angered by a sexual advance by gay college student Matthew Shepard inside the same bar that Shepard later met up with his alleged killers.
