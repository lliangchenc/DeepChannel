While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates. This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment. Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs (dlrs 535). PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) - France has raised its unemployment benefits by 2.45 percent as of July 1, announced Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac, president of the unemployment insurance regime of UNEDIC. Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country. France's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5 percent in November, but nearly 3 million people remain without a job, the Labor Ministry said Friday. The 12.5 percent unemployment rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and unionists staged several protests over the past week against unemployment. The fight against poverty and social exclusion is considered by Frenchmen and Frenchwomen as the second most important issue of the country after unemployment, said a poll published by the newspaper "Le Croix" today.
