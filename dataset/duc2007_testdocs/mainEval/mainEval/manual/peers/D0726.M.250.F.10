Spector was deputy communications director of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and was involved in several national political campaigns before that. Later, the vice president ate lunch with contributors to his 2000 presidential campaign and moderated a public forum on long-term health care. About 80 people attended the fund-raiser for Gore, where a spokesman for his presidential campaign said the campaign expected to net about $150,000 from the visit. He promised additional family-friendly policies as president. Bush is the father of George w. Bush, the GOP front-runner in the 2000 presidential campaign. Five of the last 10 presidents first served as vice president. Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon b. Johnson in 1968. Klain's departure had been expected for several weeks, since Gore named Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, general chairman of his presidential campaign. Gore's campaign had been the target of recent criticism from gop leaders saying he lacks the thick roster of endorsements compiled by Republican front-runner Texas Gov. George w. Bush. Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican presidential front-runner George w. Bush. Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
