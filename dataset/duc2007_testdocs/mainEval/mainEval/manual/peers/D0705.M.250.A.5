DEBA, Spain - A bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque separatists. ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque provinces in the north. As NATO rushes troops and equipment to the Balkans, a powerful ethnic separatist movement is building toward a showdown on the Alliance's own Atlantic flank. The cease-fire was answered by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar with a hard-line crackdown, deeply alienating most voters and ending decades of cooperation between Basque moderates and Spanish political parties. Madrid has officially prohibited the convention, setting the stage for a confrontation over Basque ties to the Kurds. The armed Basque separatist movement ETA accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the Basque language. An estimated 600,000 people speak Euskera in the seven Basque provinces in Spain and France, according to the University of the Basque Country, in San Sebastian. The armed Basque separatist group ETA has announced an open-ended cease-fire, a newspaper reported late Wednesday.
