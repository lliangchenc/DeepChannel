However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. 
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence. 
Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries. 
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie. 
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue of Islamic law and that it was not essentially an Executive issue. 
The paper issued an editorial Tuesday, saying that Rushdie has to face death sentence because no one has the right to change the divine command. 
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
