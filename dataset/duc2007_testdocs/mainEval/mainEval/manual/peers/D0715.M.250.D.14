Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced. It has been two years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly negotiated in Oslo. The Mozambican Anti-landmine Campaign has called upon the parliaments of the Community of Portuguese-speaking States to approve the Ottawa Convention, which bans production, use and stock of lethal land mines, as soon as possible. Kenya will next year ratify the Ottawa Treaty banning the use of land mines, according to a senior Kenyan government official. With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed. An international treaty to ban land mines that kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace. South Africa is to join more than 100 countries in Canada this week to sign a treaty banning the use or possession of anti-personnel mines. A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has made a significant difference in its first 18 months, but major blackspots among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain, anti-mine campaigners said Thursday.
