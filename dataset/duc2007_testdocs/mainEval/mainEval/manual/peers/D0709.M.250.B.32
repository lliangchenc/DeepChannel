Oscar winners Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie were married here in a no-frills, quickie ceremony.

Angelina Jolie has it all: the awards, her choice of Hollywood roles and the adoration of gossip columnists who have found the motherlode.

After that movie, Jolie said, she needed something down to earth.

But Jolie said Lara is a good role model, and the actress doesn't care how her professional and personal choices are perceived.

"Gone in 60 Seconds" overcame generally poor reviews that said the action flick squandered the talents of Oscar-winning stars Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall.

Thornton was hospitalized last weekend and his wife, "Girl, Interrupted" Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie, rushed from shooting a movie in England to be at his side.

"Playing By Heart": Willard Carroll, director; with Madeleine Stowe, Angelina Jolie, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid.

The Sony Pictures film remake of "Charlie's Angels" will star Drew Barrymore , Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie.

The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.

It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.

Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.

Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both playing variations of roles that they are known for.
