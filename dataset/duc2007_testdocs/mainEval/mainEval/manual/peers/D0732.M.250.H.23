Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has challenged investors to consider investing in higher education in Kenya, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper said Saturday.  Kenya has a shortage of over 200 science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country, Kenyan Minister for Education Joseph Kamotho said today.  The Kenyan government has decided to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate a business culture among children in the eastern African country.  In a statement, the AEF organizer said the AEF is to enhance political commitment towards the goal of "education for all" and urge government donors and non-governmental organizations to invest more in the education sector especially in the education of girls.  Under the new bill, only foreign universities recognized in their mother countries will qualify to operate campuses in Kenya, he [Kalonzo Musyoka] said.

Top Kenyan education official has requested the international community to assist it in raising 11 million shillings (about 160,000 U.S.dollars) to implement the HIV/AIDS awareness courses in schools in the east African country.  The United States will give 350,000 U.S. dollars to a Kenyan project aimed at linking the east African country's universities to the Internet, a U.S. official has said.  The World Bank has decided to issue a 1.6-billion-Shilling (26.66 million U.S. Dollars) grant to help Kenya develop early childhood education in the next three years.
