The school has developed a comprehensive arts program in partnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural institutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped write the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach students about different art forms. While many public schools, struggling under budget constraints and competing academic interests, are marginalizing arts programs, if not eliminating them altogether, the opposite is happening in the small village of Greenport at the tip of the North Fork on Long Island. Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools. A school in the western part of east China's Fujian Province has been set up to provide more qualified professionals, and sports, arts, and music teachers for primary and middle schools in rural areas. The goal of Pew Charitable Trust is to give money to support arts financing, zoning in historic areas and arts curriculum for public schools, said Stephen K. Urice, who will direct the Pew initiative. Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative writing. Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can affect overall student achievement. In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests.
