The introduction of the Euro is expected to stimulate European integration, help establish a more balanced world financial system and exert influence on the world's economy and politics.

The founder countries of the euro, as the new single currency is known, are scheduled to adopt new currency while banks and exchanges will start using euro in all scriptural transactions such as writing checks, using credit and charge cards, and buying bonds and stocks.  Once confirmed by Saturday's summit of European heads of state and government, the 11 euro countries will have to prepare to put 70 billion euro into circulation while pool another 50 billion euro in the reserve to make the new money impregnable against speculators.  The announcement to offer an unofficial market in the new single currency before it [the Euro] effectively comes into existence shows a strong sign that the financial markets have fully accepted the launch of the euro.

Speculation has surrounded the euro's launch, with some economists predicting countries may switch the foreign reserves from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which represents some of the strongest economies of the world.  The euro will rival the U.S. dollar as an international currency over the long term. Duisenberg expects the future relationship between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect on Jan. 12, to be stable.  

Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps to get prepared for the Euro, adding that the country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
