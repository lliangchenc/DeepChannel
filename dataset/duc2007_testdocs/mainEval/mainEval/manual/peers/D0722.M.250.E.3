The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system. 
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained a national missile defense (NMD) program, expressing concern that it could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia. 
He favors a NMD but does not believe that the system should be deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote. 
The missile defense system would be too costly and undermine the strategic arms treaties with Russia. 
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States and Russia are limited to build a single BMD system. 
A rocket carrying an optical sensor and data system was fired from Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands for the test under the NMD program. 
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a NMD system by 1999 and to decide whether to deploy it within three years. 
India's nuclear tests in the last couple of days backed Republican lawmakers' call for a NMD system. 
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a NMD system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. 
Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
