In her 1992 election, her opponent, conservative television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, out-polled her in several key Central Valley counties : Fresno (55 percent to 37 percent), Merced (49 percent to 39 percent) and Madera (60 percent to 32 percent).
WASHINGTON - California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate.
Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.
Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two articles of impeachment now being tried.
She is a respected politic a l moder a te, a s Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong - who lost to Barbara Boxer last year - seemed to concede when he repeatedly commended Feinstein in his stump speech, declaring that Boxer " is no Dianne Feinstein."
Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be opponents combined, a comm a nding le a d in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to become governor.
