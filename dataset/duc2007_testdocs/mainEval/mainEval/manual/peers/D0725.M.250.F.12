MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated Thursday that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Iran's activity in the nuclear sphere is being controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has not reported any violations on the part of that country, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said. Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has just returned from a visit to Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Rakhmanin said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently criticized the Russia-Iran agreement as a threat to the entire region. He expressed hope that Russia will revise this initiative because, he said, it contradicts attempts to achieve peace and stability in the region, Interfax reported. JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare interview to an Israeli TV station, Pakistan's minister of information said Friday that his country was not cooperating with Iran on nuclear technology. Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing by Pakistan and India. ``Pakistan has no cooperation with any other country on the nuclear issue or the missile issue,'' Mushahid Hussein said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV. Channel 2 however said that despite a lack of diplomatic relations, Pakistan was open to the station's request for an interview which was conducted with the help of a Pakistani broadcast company.
