WASHINGTON - The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials to weapons. U.S. efforts to persuade Russia to stop providing nuclear technology to Iran have met with little success. Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them. The baseless ballyhoos of the U.S. and Israel are aimed at blocking the development of other countries, which is their legitimate right, he said. He contended that Iran will not deprive itself of utilizing nuclear technology for its development drive. Russia expressed satisfaction with Iran's declaration that it was committed to the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and had no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons. Under the Israeli pressure, the U.S. Congress is considering to impose sanctions against Russian companies reportedly involved in transferring nuclear and missile technologies to Iran. Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran could aid Iran's alleged nuclear weapons plans, but Russia argued that the plant is purely for peaceful purposes.
