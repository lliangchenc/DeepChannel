In a reversal, the government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label "organic" for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top Agriculture official told farmers Thursday.  Washington (AP) -- consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores.  Washington (AP) -- the government today released new national standards for growing and processing organic food that will bar the use of genetic engineering or irradiation.  The number of organic milk cows grew from 2,265 to 12,897.  Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.  Washington -- more than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.  The rules also prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.  In late 1997 the department of Agriculture proposed rules that would have established a nationwide certification program for organic foods.  When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving the Americans in the dust.  The concept of organic food-products grown in the optimal ecological environment and subject to a thorough quality control process -- first appeared in China ten years ago.  Products and processes are standardized and trademarked to protect consumers.  Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in China's agriculture and food production.
