He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes. Iran has neither the technological capability nor the intention of making nuclear weapons, said Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Nikitovich Mikhailov, in February 1998. The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. Stressing that it has no nuclear cooperation program with Ukraine, Iran, in March 1998, expressed "surprise" at Kiev's announcement to cancel a nuclear contract with it, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported. Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever growing stock of nuclear arsenal. Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability. Senior Iranian officials, in November 1998, assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries. Russia reiterated that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain nuclear capability, a charge repeatedly denied by Tehran. The Clinton administration expressed new worry, in January 2000, over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
