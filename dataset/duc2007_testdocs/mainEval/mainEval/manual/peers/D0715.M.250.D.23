France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N. officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines.  Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday.  Namibia has become the 24th country to ratify the Ottawa Convention banning land mines.  Kenya will next year ratify the Ottawa Treaty banning the use of land mines.  Jordan signed a global land mine treaty Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact, which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.  South Africa is to join more than 100 countries in Canada this week to sign a treaty banning the use or possession of anti-personnel mines.  With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they [UNITED NATION] want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.  Noor said it was encouraging that major producers and exporters including France, Germany, Britain and Hungary had already ratified the treaty.

The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their borders. 

Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
