The Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue of Islamic law and that "it was not essentially an Executive issue."
Observers here said that the indirect talks on Salman Rushdie between EU and Tehran is producing some understanding.
The Iranian foreign minister today declined to comment on whether the thorny issue of the Salman Rushdie affairs will be dealt with during his forthcoming trip to Italy.
Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York that "we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely finished."
Stopping short of revoking a death sentence against Rushdie, Iran says it won't adopt any measures that threaten his life, or anyone connected to his book -- The Satanic Verses.
In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest Iran, said they were "ready to carry out the edict against Salman Rushdie,"
