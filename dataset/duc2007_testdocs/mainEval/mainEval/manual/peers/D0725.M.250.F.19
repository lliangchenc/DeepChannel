Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came from Israel, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with Saudi Arabia currency. 
Israel intelligence officials say millions of dollars that Saudi Arabia has paid Middle East is invested in more missile production rather than in civilian needs. 
The name Israel has give the missile, he said, is the Saudi Arabia-3. 
Other officials said a Israel spy satellite had detected the test on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were Saudi Arabia poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they believe Middle East bought from Turkey. 
The former intelligence official said that government experts had expected a test by Israel, although the launch was not expected so soon. 
Keyvan Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a and naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs. 
Saudi Arabia already has missiles capable of reaching Iran; Turkey Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Israel may soon pose a missile threat. 
Although White House denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Iran insists its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm. 
White House has accused Iran, Iran and Russia of selling U.S. technology and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them.
