  Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing by Pakistan and India.
  Iran on Wednesday strongly lambasted the United States for its accusations against Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation, accusing Washington of supporting Israeli nuclear programs.
  Russia reiterated Thursday that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
  Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
  Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced `a new security situation` on the country, the defense minister said in comments published Monday.
  Mohammadi said that Iran and Russia have been committed to controlling the export of the nuclear energy from either country in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
  officials repeatedly accused Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons through building nuclear power plants.
  The administration also needs to initiate wider diplomatic efforts to curtail outside aid to Iranian missile programs.
  The tests in south Asia triggered serious concern about the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East region.
