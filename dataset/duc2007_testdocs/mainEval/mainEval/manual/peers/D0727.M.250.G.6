Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband transferred ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
Gingrich has denied the allegation.
Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from Ohio, referred all questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney John Mayoue.
Gingrich, who now runs a political consulting firm, filed his request after his wife asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Gingrich, 56, separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed for divorce in July.
Since then, lawyers for Mrs. Gingrich have attempted to probe his finances, business dealings and his relationship with Ms. Bisek.
On Thursday, the former Speaker released a temporary financial agreement he and his wife signed last month that pays each about $10,000 a month.
Ms. Bisek also said she should not be required to testify about her relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination, since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia.
Earlier this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final.
The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker.
Those include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms. Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video recordings of the two.
