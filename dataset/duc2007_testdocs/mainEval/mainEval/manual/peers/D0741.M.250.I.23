After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death with a hammer, and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people in the brokerage houses where he traded, Mark O. Barton typed a chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to live just long enough to kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction.''  He [Barton] committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two trading offices, plus his  two children and his second wife.

Police say they [police] have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.  As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.

Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he [Barton] methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.  Colleagues who had lent Barton money were among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day trading offices.  But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday.
