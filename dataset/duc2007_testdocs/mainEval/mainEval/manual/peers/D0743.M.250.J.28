Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive, 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial heartland.
The quake damaged bridges, highways, power stations, telephone lines, and triggered a fire at Turkey's largest oil refinery.
The massive quake has killed over 12,000 people and injured over 33,000 others in the region since then.
The number of casualties may still increase as the rescue workers are continuing sifting through piles of rubble of the collapsed buildings in the tremor-hit cities in search for survivors and the bodies of the dead.
Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit.
It is a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake destroyed jerry-built apartment buildings, crushing some 17,000 people as they slept.
The epicenter of the aftershock was about 130 kilometers about east of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4 killer quake struck western Turkey.
Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the affected areas closed until further notice.
Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey.
In a number of state hospitals, the personnel had to go without sleep for 40 hours or more.
