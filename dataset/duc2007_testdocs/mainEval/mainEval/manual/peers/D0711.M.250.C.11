Salt LAKE CITY (AP) -- the trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. has been postponed from June until next January.  The Justice department's landmark antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have cost $13.3 million over the past decade, the department said Wednesday in its first public accounting.  The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business lawsuits in decades.  After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade Commission told Microsoft Corp. Friday to change permanently one of its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch its step in the Internet browser market.  Here are the milestones in Microsoft's antitrust dealings with the government:  May 30 -- the federal Trade Commission staff opens an antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. the agency ponders charges that Microsoft illegally thwarted competition while adding hidden codes to its operating system software in a bid to hinder competing applications vendors.  Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept "an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune," a federal judge ruled Monday.  The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company.  A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
