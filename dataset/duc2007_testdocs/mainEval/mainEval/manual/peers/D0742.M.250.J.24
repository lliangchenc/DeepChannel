At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight--and less than 20 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport--Kennedy's plane vanished from air-traffic control radar screens. It was made at 10:05 p.m. Friday, only 25 minutes after Kennedy's plane was lost on radar and presumably crashed into the ocean. Kennedy was flying to Martha's Vineyard to drop off Lauren Bessette, after which he planned to fly to Hyannis to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy. 

Aboard the plane were his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman. A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law. John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane. 

'One of John F. Kennedy Jr.' s flight instructors, believing him unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night, offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash. 'The U.S. Coast Guard incurred costs totaling $287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F. Kennedy Jr.' s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday.
