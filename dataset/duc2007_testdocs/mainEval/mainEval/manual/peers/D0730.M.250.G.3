Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Justice Department is planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before the end of the term in late June or early July. 
While the Line Item Veto Act skirts a constitutional edge, it does not violate any basic separation of powers principle. 
In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court because the statute does not give the president new veto authority. 
New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997. 
What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to cancel an item of spending is technically different. 
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
