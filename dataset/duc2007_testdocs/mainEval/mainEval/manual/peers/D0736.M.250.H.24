Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is starting a magazine next spring with the magazine publisher Hearst Corp.

Natkin and Green said the money allowed Winfrey to put the photos in publicity packages for her TV talk show but not in the book. On the eve of the premiere of her TV talk show, the Duchess of York promised that she would be good.
