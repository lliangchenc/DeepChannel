Israel, in September 1998, assured Cyprus that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel. "Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus," Tzur said. Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's Foreign Ministry announced, in November 1998, that two Israelis arrested in Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey. Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said. Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents. A senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus -- the third botched spy mission in a year. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, in February 1999, that Israel would do everything it could to bring about the repatriation of the two Mossad agents who were sentenced to three years in prison in Cyprus. Two agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were released by Cyprus, in August 1999. Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis jailed in Cyprus. Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit to the island country in 1998.
