DECATUR, Ga. (AP) -- It's been a painful year for the families and friends of the nine people killed last summer at two Atlanta brokerage offices. 

Many of them came together to share their experiences at a memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church Sunday, a year and a day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through All-Tech Investment Group's trading office. 

Liz Webb, whose brother Scott Webb was killed July 29, 1999, said she decided to visit the building where her brother traded and died. But it didn't ease her grief, she said. 

''It never leaves,'' Webb said after the service, wiping tears from her eyes. ''It never goes away.'' 

The service was organized by Dr. Gulshan Harjee, whose husband was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech and Momentum Securities. Harjee said she hoped the service might allow victims' families to visit and offer each other solace. 

Police said Barton, who had reportedly lost more than $400,000 from his investments, killed his wife and two young children the day before his rampage. 

The three -- Leigh Ann Barton, and her children, Matthew and Michelle -- were included in the service bulletin, and a candle for each victim was lighted at the front of the church. 

Hours after the shooting, Barton fatally shot himself when police stopped his minivan at a convenience store northwest of Atlanta.
