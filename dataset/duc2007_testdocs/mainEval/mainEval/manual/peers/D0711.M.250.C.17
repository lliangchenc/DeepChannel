The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp., U.S. newspapers reported, on September 21, 1996. The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. has been postponed from June until next January. Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its 25-year history. Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust actions against the company. Microsoft would have to satisfy them all. After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft, in March 2000, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said. Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said, in April 2000, that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices. Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial. Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
