The court said the constitutional language does not allow what in effect would be partial vetoes. The high court agreed. In a 6-3 decision, the court declared unconstitutional a McCain-sponsored law giving the president authority to wipe out wasteful programs contained in larger spending bills. Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws. The Supreme Court agreed on to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto. The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court on upheld that ruling. The court rejected a challenge from senators and representatives who said the statute violated the authority of Congress to write laws. The constitutional return takes place before the bill becomes law; the statutory cancellation occurs after the bill becomes law. In sum, i recognize that the act before us is novel. But the court said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto. The court said the Constitution does not allow for what, in effect, are partial vetoes. But the court said that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional. The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch.
