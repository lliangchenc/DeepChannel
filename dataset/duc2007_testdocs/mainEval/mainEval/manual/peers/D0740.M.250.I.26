 Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard and his British teammate Brian Jones had passed and were setting a course for a six-day journey across the ocean. The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight has been offered a berth taking its place with a host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane, which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever made around the world. The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico. A Swiss-English balloon team was about 300 miles from Jamaica late night and hoped to catch the next jet stream over the eastern Caribbean. The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon landed gently at 08:03 local time at Mut, a town in the Kakhla Oasis 485 kilometers southwest of Cairo. The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as the balloon approached the Mexican coast. A British balloon, the Cable & Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean. A Swiss psychiatrist, and his co-pilot, Brian Jones, a 52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company. Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey beamed.
