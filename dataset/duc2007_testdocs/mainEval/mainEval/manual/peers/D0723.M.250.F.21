Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate.    Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.    Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two articles of impeachment now being tried.Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.    ``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.Moving a censure resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said. ``I would hope at the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said.    Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated that, as far as he was concerned, the matter was closed and the Senate would not take up censure again.
