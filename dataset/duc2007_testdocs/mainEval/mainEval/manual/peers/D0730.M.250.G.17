The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before the end of the term in late June or early July. The Supreme Court agreed, in February 1998, to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto. The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures. Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act "succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court" because the statute does not give the president new veto authority, Scalia said. The President's action it authorizes in fact is not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art. The Line Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' "Contract With America." The U.S. Supreme Court, in June 1998, struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. The Line Item Veto Act was struck down. The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act unconstitutional -- that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch. It was only after the requirements of the Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the president exercised his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel the spending item.
