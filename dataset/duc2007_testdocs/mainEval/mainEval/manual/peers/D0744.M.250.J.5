More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label. The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies. The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of what constitutes organic food. When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales for 1999 are $6.46 billion. Critics of the organic industry say the rules could lead consumers into thinking organic products are safer or more nutritious than conventional food. WASHINGTON - New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide. The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge. Like much of the rest of the world, the United States continues to lurch toward a national standard for organic food. Meanwhile, the U.S. organic industry continues to see unprecedented growth.
