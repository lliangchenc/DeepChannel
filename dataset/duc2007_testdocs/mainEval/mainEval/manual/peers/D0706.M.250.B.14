A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma. The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar. The demonstration was staged to mark the 10th anniversary of the seizure of power by military generals in Maynmar, formerly Burma. Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover. Myanmar Tuesday demanded that the Thai government strictly control refugee camps on the Thai side of the two countries' border. For example, there has been much debate about whether we are more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions. At least 20 more members of various anti-government armed groups in Myanmar surrendered to the government last month, the Mirror newspaper reported Thursday. Forced labor, including child labor, are widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights, the U.S. Labor Department said in a report Monday. The SLORC - State Law and Order Restoration Council - which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat.
