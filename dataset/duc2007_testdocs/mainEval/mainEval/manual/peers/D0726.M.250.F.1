STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Stamford woman has become the official yarmulke maker of the Gore-Lieberman presidential ticket. 

After hearing that Stamford-native Lieberman had been chosen as Al Gore's running mate, Marsha Greenberg decided to knit him a gift. 

The end result was a blue yarmulke with red and white striped letters reading, ''Gore-Lieberman 2000.'' A yarmulke is a skull cap worn by Jewish males as a sign of humility before God. 

''As the first Orthodox Jew who's gotten so far, I knew he would wear it if I could get it to him,'' she said. ''It's the campaign yarmulke.'' 

Greenberg called Harold Bernstein, a cousin of Lieberman and president of Congregation Agudath Sholom, which she attends. Bernstein passed along the skull cap to one of Lieberman's aides at the Italian Center of Stamford, where the senator and Vice President Al Gore visited Wednesday night. 

Greenberg was later told about a playful struggle between the two candidates over her handiwork. 

''Senator Lieberman thought it was wonderful, but Gore just flipped and took it from Lieberman,'' Greenberg said. ''It was like two boys fighting.'' 

The next day, when it became apparent Gore really was intent on keeping the yarmulke, a Lieberman aide called Bernstein to ask Greenberg if she could make another for the senator. 

Greenberg agreed. 

Bernstein will take the yarmulke to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles next week to present it to Lieberman. 

Greenberg said it takes about eight hours of stitch-work to complete the cap.
