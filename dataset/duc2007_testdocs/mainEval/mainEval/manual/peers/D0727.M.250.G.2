By the time Gingrich arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday to a bittersweet welcome party organized by staff, House Republicans already had shifted their allegiance to Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), the lanky chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who will be named speaker by his colleagues on Wednesday. In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final. Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge is set to hear arguments this morning about what gifts, records and other documents Gingrich's girlfriend, Callista Bisek, must turn over in his Cobb County, Ga., divorce. Back in the mid-1980s, well before he was House speaker, Newt Gingrich used to take long walks around the National Mall, the great public square that ties together all of Washington's grand monuments. Gingrich himself set the tone, coming in to work after lunch with Marianne and daughters Jackie Sue Cushman and Kathy Gingrich-Lubbers at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a Washington institution near the White House. The Gingriches, who hadn't seen each other in person since June, spent much of the session in separate rooms at the Cobb County law offices of John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney. Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker.
