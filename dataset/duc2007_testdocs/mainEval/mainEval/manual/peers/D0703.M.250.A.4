European Union's single-currency plan will take effect in 11 of its member states on January 1, 1999, when the euro will become a currency in the financial sense, but will first be used only in cashless tradings. Speculation has surrounded the euro's launch, with some economists predicting countries may switch the foreign reserves from the US dollar to the euro, which represents some of the strongest economies of the world. In response to a question concerning the issue at today's news conference, Zhu said the introduction of the Euro is expected to stimulate European integration, help establish a more balanced world financial system and exert influence on the world's economy and politics. The Romanian banking system is ready to perform services in the European single currency, the euro, the Rompres news agency reported on Tuesday citing sources from Romania's Central Bank.

Local press reports today said that the building societies have produced blueprints for euro savings accounts, passbooks and cash-dispensers despite the government's increasingly Eurosceptical tone. Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
