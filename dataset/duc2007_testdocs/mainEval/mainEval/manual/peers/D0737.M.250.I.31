Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica. The reports said the insurance company plans to use a mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in about 200 feet of water. It also means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better state of preservation than those found in shallower water. When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic, it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean depths. Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators. Sea electromagnetic surveying is an advanced benthal exploration measure. Its fate was one of the lake's big mysteries until 1995, when Bateaux Below divers found the rusted hulk in deep water, midlake. Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data. Monday's session on space and sea exploration featured gee-whiz science demonstrations and scientists' musings on what future explorations might yield. In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact. Divers say the chest is sunk in
