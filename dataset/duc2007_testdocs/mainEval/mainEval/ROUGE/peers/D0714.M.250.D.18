Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music sharing software.
The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific artists or titles from being traded, so " the upshot of Metallica's notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all " for any music.
The Napster members were identified by their user names, which they gave Napster when they registered to download the program, along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their numerical Internet Protocol address.
The Offspring and Chuck D of Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone who thinks otherwise is old school.
One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S. Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that " over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more." The Napster software links users to various servers run by Napster Inc.
People can easily search for any MP3-formated song stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users.
