ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it already operates inside the park.
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park.
The Australian government's environmental report on the Jabiluka uranium mine (located in Kakadu Natural Park), found the area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park.
A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, the council said it was particularly concerned about the Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from the mine entrance.
``The mission has noted severe ascertained and potential dangers to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu National Park, posed primarily by the proposal for uranium mining and milling at Jabiluka,''.
