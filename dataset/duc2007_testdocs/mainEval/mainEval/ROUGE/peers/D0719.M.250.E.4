Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed to a rise in crime and violence (parf-dgs).
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.
It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in France be solved through "making the country's benefit system less generous" The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the flexibility of work schedules.
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
The major causes for suicides in France are economic crisis, unemployment, isolation as well as a decrease of the number of religious services and practices, said the INED.
A continuous drop of unemployment rate in France has been observed since July 1997, when the Socialist government led by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin came into power.
The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which stands around 125 percent, reflects the "substantial structural impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
