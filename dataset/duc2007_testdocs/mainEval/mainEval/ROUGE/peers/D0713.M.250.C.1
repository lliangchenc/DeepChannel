ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Tuesday that it will maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any aggression against it.
"We will act according to our best national security and national interest," Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Iftikhar Murshid said at a press conference here while answering a question about reported possible further nuclear tests by India.
"Our nuclear policy is to maintain credible nuclear deterrence, " he added.
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998.
"We did not initiate the induction of weapons capability into the region.
Nor was Pakistan the first to conduct nuclear explosive tests," the statement said.
It accused India's nuclear tests of destabilizing the security environment in South Asia, saying Pakistan's tests "restored the strategic balance".
"Therefore, the distinction between the nuclear ambitions of India and the compulsions of Pakistan must be acknowledged and preserved," it said.
The sixth NPT review conference, which Pakistan "decided not to attend because of the changed nuclear realities in South Asia," ended in New York on May 20.
Pakistan expressed its appreciation of the conference's call for the observance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), describing it as "a positive contribution to the strengthening of the no-test norm".
