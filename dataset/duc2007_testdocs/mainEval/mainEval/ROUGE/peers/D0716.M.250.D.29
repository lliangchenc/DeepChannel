A high-level United Nations delegation began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
The Australian government today gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining plan.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu.
The protesters want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
The mine could damage the environment.
Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km.
The Sydney Morning Herald Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased.
The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine.
Thousands of tourists visit the park every year.
The government-approved mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu National Park.
The committee called for the scrapping of the mine.
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has begun construction of the Jabiluka mine.
Environmental groups and local Aborigines oppose the mine.
The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
ERA and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the park.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
