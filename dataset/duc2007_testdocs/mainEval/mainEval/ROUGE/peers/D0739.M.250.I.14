While the special was titled "I'm Telling You for the Last Time" most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes for the first time.
While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the ending of the phenomenal run of "Seinfeld" after 140 episodes, he's relieved it's over.
During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld was asked what it was like to end the run of his hit comedy series.
Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the principal roles on "Seinfeld": Jason Alexander, who played George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld.
Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final "Seinfeld" episode is receding, the performance highlights why he became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his style of stand-up has become.
But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like "Seinfeld," becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
On Thursday, we will move a feature on Seinfeld's new show and the hoopla surrounding it.
All right, so "Seinfeld" was not perfect on paper, and bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television.
