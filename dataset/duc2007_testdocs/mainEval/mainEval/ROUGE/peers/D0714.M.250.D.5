In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
Last week, the recording industry and the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users download music and video files.
The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc., the Sony Corp., Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by the recording association, sued the service for copyright infringement.
In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him "an unheard of" 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.
The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
