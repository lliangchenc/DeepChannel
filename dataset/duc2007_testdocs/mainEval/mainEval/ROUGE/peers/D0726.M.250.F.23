Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization, aides to the vice president said Thursday.
An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff; another former vice presidential chief of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
, who is one of Gore's best friends.
In the view of many political experts, Gore will enter the 2000 campaign as the leading Democratic candidate, after a political career that spans eight years as a House member from Tennessee, eight years in the Senate and six years as vice president.
Vice President Al Gore declared ``a new day'' in his presidential bid Wednesday with a symbolic homecoming and the opening of a new campaign headquarters far from the constant political intrigue and daily odds-making of Washington.
Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
Vice President Al Gore, who continues to reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today.
