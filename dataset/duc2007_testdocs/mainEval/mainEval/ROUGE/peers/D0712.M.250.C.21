_ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that his government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, paving the way for upgrading strained ties with the United Kingdom.
_ British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said.
``It means everything''.
Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the development that came out British talks with Iran in New York, Rushdie said: ``It seems that this has been done in Iran with consensus''.
Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream opposition within Iran.
_ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether anything has really changed.
In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict against Salman Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York that ``we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely finished''.
