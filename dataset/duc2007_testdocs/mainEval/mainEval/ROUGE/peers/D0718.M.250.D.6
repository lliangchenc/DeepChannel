Outside, a man passed out leaflets charging Starbucks ``exploits prison labor''.
A Starbucks spokeswoman said she knew nothing about the charges and couldn't respond.
A block south, at the year-old Lottie Motts Espresso Shop, Autumn Eaton paused between making lattes to say she is ``disappointed'' that Starbucks will be a competitor.
Schultz earlier said that Starbucks stores ``enlarge the coffee-drinking community and there is usually enough business for all.'' In July, the San Francisco-based Spinelli Coffee Co. was purchased by Tully's Coffee Corp., another Seattle company.
Pasqua, which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks banner, operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and New York, and has eight licensed airport locations in California.
In addition, the company has a coffee roastery in San Francisco, three commissaries and two bakeries.
Still, the impetus for Starbucks to take the Tazo purchase seriously must be pretty strong, given recent trends in the specialty coffee business, Rasmussen said.
At last year's Specialty Coffee Association trade show, for instance, Rasmussen noted, at least 50 percent of the vendors devoted half their exhibit space to tea products.
``I think people have reached their limit with coffee in terms of their experience with it,'' she said.
The New York Times Co. and Starbucks Coffee Co. said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times' advertising promotion of Starbucks.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
