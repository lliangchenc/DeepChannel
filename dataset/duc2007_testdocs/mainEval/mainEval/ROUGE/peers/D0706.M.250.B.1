When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Thailand for this week's ministerial meeting of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, she will demonstrate American support for a regional grouping that can boast of many successes and one flagrant failure _ the military dictatorship ruining Burma.
It is becoming harder and harder for ASEAN members to ignore the depredations of the Burmese junta.
No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's crimes than host Thailand.
For much of the past decade, the Thais have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military officers.
At the recent AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, rightly praised the Thai government for its success in implementing policies to reduce the spread of HIV.
But the uniformed thugs who rule Burma are undermining those hard-won triumphs.
Whereas Bangkok has achieved exemplary progress in substituting legal cash crops for the poppies used to make heroin, Burma under the junta continues to be a principal source for the heroin that destroys lives from Bangkok to Boston.
And where there is heroin addiction there is an inevitable increase in the rate of HIV infections and cases of AIDS.
Recently, a new evil has come cascading into Thailand from Burma: millions of easily smuggled tablets of the stimulant methamphetamine.
