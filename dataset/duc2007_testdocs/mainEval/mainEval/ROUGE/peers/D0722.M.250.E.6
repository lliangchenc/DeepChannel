But the United States wants to modify the treaty so it can build a limited defense against attack by rogue states, such as North Korea.
``The president has made some decisions that will enable us to begin engaging Russia now on changes on the ABM treaty that would be necessary if we seek to deploy a limited national missile defense system,'' Rubin said.
President Boris Yeltsin agreed in June to discuss ABM modifications, but Russian officials continue to insist that an anti-missile defense system in the United States would tilt the strategic balance and start a new arms race.
In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy, the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise missiles.
It could take years before scientists and the defense industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, intercontinental missile.
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
Several independent scientists questioned the importance of Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the results were going to be misleading.
