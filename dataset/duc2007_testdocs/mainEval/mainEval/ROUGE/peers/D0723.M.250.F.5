Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
Two years later, she ran for the Senate.
Feinstein's time has been spent preparing for the general election.
Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell, conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.
Boxer will now take Feinstein's seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep. Tom Campbell's entry Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national significance.
Now that she is their opponent, Republicans have begun to portray Feinstein as less accommodating, insisting the crowning achievements of her Senate career the creation of a new national park in the Mojave Desert and the enactment of a ban on assault weapons are not so popular in the burgeoning suburbs and inland cities far from the coast.
