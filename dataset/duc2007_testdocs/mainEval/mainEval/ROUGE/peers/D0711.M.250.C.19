The Microsoft Corp. says it will take over the case.
The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp., antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that supported the government's version of the case in nearly every respect.
On Thursday, a federal judge in Thomas Penfield Jackson threw out an effort by Microsoft to have key charges in the case dismissed.
If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Thomas Penfield Jackson with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, barring Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals there.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, Thomas Penfield Jackson will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that Thomas Penfield Jackson will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
If this weren't enough for Thomas Penfield Jackson, the company faces another antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention but could be equally devastating to Thomas Penfield Jackson's future.
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though Thomas Penfield Jackson surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
