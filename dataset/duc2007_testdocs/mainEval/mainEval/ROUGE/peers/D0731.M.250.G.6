Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House intern's affair with President Clinton.
In return, she received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution.
State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has tried unsuccessfully since July to obtain the tapes, which remain in Starr's custody.
All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry, unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.

(A daily columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roeper has also written for TV Guide, Spy, Playboy, Chicago magazine and many other publications, and has appeared as a guest on ``Nightline'' and ``Oprah.'') U.S. House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The House Judiciary Committee released 22 hours of the tapes, which triggered independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Lewinsky case and led to his report to Congress alleging impeachable offenses by Clinton.
Prior to this, an edited transcript of the tapes was made public in October.
