The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
San Francisco -- the battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto the streets of San Mateo, Calif., Wednesday as Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and controversial music-sharing software.
The battle lines are drawn.
San Francisco -- the crackdown on Napster has reached the corporate workplace.
San Francisco -- in a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
San Francisco -- Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
