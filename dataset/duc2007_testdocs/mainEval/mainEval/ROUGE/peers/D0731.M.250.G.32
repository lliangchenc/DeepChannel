Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise money for her legal fees.
Under criminal investigation in Maryland, Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
A prosecutor does not have to release a summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest court has ruled.
The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Maryland's wiretapping case against Linda Tripp came to an official end Wednesday as a Howard County judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the impeachment of President Clinton.
Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp.
The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Thursday.
Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes.
But it was a new Linda Tripp, so comprehensively "made over" as to be almost unrecognizable.
