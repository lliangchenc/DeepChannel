Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
The Australian government's environmental report on the Jabiluka uranium mine located in Kakadu Natural Park, to be released Thursday, found the area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles 300 kms east of Darwin.
Construction of the Jabiluka mine _ Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade _ began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
Police have not yet said if they suspect a link between the attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
