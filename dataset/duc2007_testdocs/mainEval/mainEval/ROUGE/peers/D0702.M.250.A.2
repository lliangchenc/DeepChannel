Written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive psychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed by Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, something happens to young children when they are given keyboard lessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts, and for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on spatial reasoning tests improves.
