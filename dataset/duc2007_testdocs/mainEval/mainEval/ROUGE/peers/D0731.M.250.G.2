Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg--who urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy--teamed to expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
The tapes bought Tripp 15 minutes of fame, a federal immunity deal with the independent counsel's office, an extended visit with Starr's grand jury--and a long-term role as a punch line in Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show'' monologues.
``A little bit, but... for me, the point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way... to... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never disclosed that to the president''.
The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial.
A federal judge ordered the White House on Monday to retrieve e-mails from President Clinton and the first lady and 31 presidential aides concerning the FBI files controversy, Linda Tripp and presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky--not to mention the accompanying media frenzy--directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
