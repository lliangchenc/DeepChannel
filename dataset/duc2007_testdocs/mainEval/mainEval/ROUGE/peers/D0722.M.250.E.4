Revised estimates of nuclear missile capability, particularly of North Korea and Iran, add new urgency to development of a national missile defense system, the Clinton administration's top arms-control official said.
A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $105 billion to build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005.
The US military will conduct the eighth test of an anti-missile defense system in New Mexico State in the country Tuesday morning after seven successive test failures, the Defense Department announced Monday.
The US military successfully tested an anti-missile defense system Thursday by destroying a missile with another one high over New Mexico State, the Defense Department said.
The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today.
After six straight failures, a $38 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
In a second straight success, an experimental theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next year.
Russia has opposed construction of a US missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
