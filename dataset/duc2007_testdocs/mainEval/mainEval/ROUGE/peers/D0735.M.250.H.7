At, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
The government proposed to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change.
Calling it a success story on a par with the comeback of the bald eagle, federal wildlife officials announced that the gray wolf, hunted nearly to extinction ago, has rebounded enough to no longer be considered an endangered species in most of the country.
