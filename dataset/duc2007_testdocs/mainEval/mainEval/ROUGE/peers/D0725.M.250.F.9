Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
