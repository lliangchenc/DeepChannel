Microsoft Corp violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled Monday.
Fierce competition is one thing, the government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
Microsoft Corp's massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its 25-year history.
Microsoft says it will comply with Jackson's order by offering computer makers two new options, both of which the company claims would undermine computer performance.
Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major US antitrust case.
Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust actions against the company.
Breakup of the company could also encourage development of alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
