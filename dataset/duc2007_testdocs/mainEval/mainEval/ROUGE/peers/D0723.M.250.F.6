``Anyone who is familiar with the landscape of the Congress knows that this bill isn't is going anywhere,'' Manown said, accusing Feinstein of engaging in little more than a publicity stunt.
``If the senator ever chooses to leave public service, she will have a sterling career as a publicist.'' Feinstein has been a foe of the gun lobby since she was San Francisco's mayor nearly two decades ago and sponsored a citywide handgun ban that was approved by the Board of Supervisors but ultimately struck down by a state court.
When she ran for the Senate in 1998, she put their pictures on her campaign posters.
Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan Elected to the House in 1996, Debbie Stabenow is involved in what is shaping up to be one of the nation's most bitterly contested Senate races.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.
Asked about Feinstein's proposal, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
said it now appears that witnesses will be called and that there's no way to tell if censure will come up.
``Once you start a trial process, you don't know where and how it's going to end,'' Schumer said.
Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992 and both spoke at the convention that year.
