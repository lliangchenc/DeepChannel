Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
Even Starr never asked at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
WASHINGTON, November 17 - U.S. House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first witness on Thursday.
I know this because I heard from most of them the last time I disparaged her in print and they insist that the criminal proceedings in Maryland amount to nothing more than retaliation for her participation in Starr's investigation of Clinton.
By January of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky testified, but thought she still had a chance of persuading her to keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in the Jones suit.
