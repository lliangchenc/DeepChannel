Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
A judge hearing a lawsuit filed by the recording industry granted an injunction that would effectively shut down Napster night for infringing on copyrights.
Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site and to download their own tunes for nothing.
The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
If music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable.
At Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known artists and those who have not signed recording contracts.
Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
Intense legal battles are being waged over the use of MP3 technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in a compressed form.
Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and Napster, have stepped into this vacuum.
From the judge's language, this was not a close call.
Metallica's suit has gone to extremes: The group members delivered to the court the names of 335,000 people whom the band accuses of illegally obtaining its songs through the site.
