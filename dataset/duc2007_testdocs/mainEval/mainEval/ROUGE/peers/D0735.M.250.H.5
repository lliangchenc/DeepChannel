In 1994, the Fish & Wildlife Service issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement on the wolf reintroduction plan.
There is little chance that the U.S. Supreme Court will grant an appeal, even if one were requested.
There is no conflict among federal appeals courts concerning the legality of the wolf reintroduction program.
The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy.
At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is wasteful of individual animals, many of which die because they do not know how to live outside a cage.
Ms. Cowan said her organization is one a handful that has pursued legal avenues to stop the reintroduction of the wolves, and admitted the wolves had not been as problematic as anticipated.
