SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The Bulgarian National Bank announced Thursday its national currency, the lev, will be fixed at 1,955.83 to the euro.
Under the currency board system established in July 1997, the domestic money supply is backed by foreign currency reserves.
Since its launch, the domestic money supply has been backed by German marks at a rate of 1,000 to the mark.
With the launch of the euro on New Year's Day, the lev will formally be backed by euros.
The currency board was established to help reduce inflation by preventing the central bank from lending to the government or local banks.
Inflation is expected to fall below 9 percent in 1998, down from 573 percent in 1997.
The government has said it will keep the currency board in place until the country is in a position to adopt the euro as its own currency.
The government doesn't expect to be in a position to begin membership negotiations with the European Union until 2001.
EU membership is a prerequisite for adopting the euro as a national currency. rr/sof
