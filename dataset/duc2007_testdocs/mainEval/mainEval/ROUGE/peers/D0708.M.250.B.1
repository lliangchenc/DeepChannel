NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The acute water shortage in the Kenyan capital Nairobi entered its third month Tuesday with water-borne diseases imminent.
The residents in the city warned that an outbreak of water-borne diseases like cholera was impending unless water supply is restored immediately in the city with a population of 2 million.
They also demanded the Nairobi City Council to announce a water rationing program to enable them to know the time to draw water, the East African Standard newspaper said.
They said that the program will save them from being exploited by unscrupulous water vendors, who usually sold a 20 litre container of water at 30 shillings (around 0.4 U.S. dollar).
City residents complained that the vendors had capitalized on the water shortage to make quick profits from people desperate for water.
"People can survive without electricity but they can not survive without water as it is an essential commodity," said Mama Njeri, a resident.
Nairobi City Council recently worked out a rationing plan but the schedule has not been made public.
Due to the current drought in the Horn of Africa, water shortage has reigned throughout the east African country and more than 2.2 million Kenyans are threatened by starvation.
