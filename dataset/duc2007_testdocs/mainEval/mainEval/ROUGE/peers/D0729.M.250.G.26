Rudolph, a 32-year-old itinerant carpenter who lived in western North Carolina, is being sought in the fatal bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta-area bombings.

NBC News reported that Rudolph left money for the food and a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
Investigators suspect he was involved in a January 1998 explosion that killed a police officer and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala.
Task force leaders said Rudolph watched local resident George Nordmann's ridgetop home 10 miles east of town for several days before approaching it on July 7, 1998, to take some food.
Although investigators found a spot where they believe Rudolph watched the home of George Nordmann, 71, for several days, the fugitive has vanished again, leaving no trail.
Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man, who operates a health food store.
