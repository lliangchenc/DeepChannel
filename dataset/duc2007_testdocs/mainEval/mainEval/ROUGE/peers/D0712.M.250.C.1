LONDON (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said.
The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. on the eve of the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict.
``Based on divine principles,...
the ruling against the apostate Salman Rushdie is still valid and nothing can change this,'' the statement reportedly said.
After Khomeini announced the sentence on Feb. 14, claiming Rushdie had blasphemed Islam in ``The Satanic Verses,'' the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly a decade in hiding under police protection.
He emerged from his shadowy existence in September 1998 when Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced the country was distancing itself from a $2.5 million reward promised for Rushdie's death.
Iran had been trying to change its foreign policy since Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, took over as president in August 1997.
He underscored the need to replace confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West.
The Rushdie affair was the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties with the European Union.
Britain and Iran agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations in May 1999 .
