WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the White House on Monday to retrieve e-mails from President Clinton and the first lady and 31 presidential aides concerning the FBI files controversy, Linda Tripp and presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
In a lawsuit brought by a conservative group, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered e-mails produced within 20 days in the case of hundreds of appointees from the Reagan and Bush administrations whose FBI background files were gathered by the Clinton White House.
While calling for a search of White House computer archives, Lamberth said he will deal later with the problem that 100,000 or more e-mails were not archived and are being reconstructed from computer back-up tapes.
The conservative group, Judicial Watch, is trying to prove that the Clinton administration routinely attacked its political enemies by using confidential material protected by the Privacy Act.
The judge is allowing the conservative group to delve into two side issues -- the use of information from Linda Tripp's personnel file at the Pentagon and the White House's release of personal letters of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
