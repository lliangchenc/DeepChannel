The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.
Under the Line Item Veto Act, the president could cancel tax breaks that benefited fewer than 101 people.
WASHINGTON, February 27 - The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto.
The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen. John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the president expanded veto power to harness "pork-barrel" spending by Congress.
The court ruled that such a specialized veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
The court's decision was a defeat for McCain, who forced a vote on a line-item veto nearly every year for a decade until its approval two years ago.
But the court said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto.
