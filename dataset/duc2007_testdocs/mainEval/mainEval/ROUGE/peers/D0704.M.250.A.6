"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed, accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu hardliners.
For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty International is making up new reports shortly before the visit by the U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month.
"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists," Ndahiro alleged.
President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more serious in its work.
He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane, Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them on how to conduct their affairs.
At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects in the east African country.
This stand was included in a press release issued by the Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their personal and political ends.
