When a label says "grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990," it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods industry, farmers, inspectors and others.
It also offers a strict standard defining what constitutes an organic food, a step that should do a great deal to enhance consumer trust that a food labeled organic really is organic.
Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in any other country and have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than encouraging them to grow organic crops.

Products grown and processed according to the standards and contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients
