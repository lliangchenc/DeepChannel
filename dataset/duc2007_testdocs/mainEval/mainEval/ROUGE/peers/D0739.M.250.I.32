Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from the show, might appear for his HBO special.
He did play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act.
During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld was asked what it was like to end the run of his hit comedy series.
Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas, when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits.
In fact, he hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
