Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky _ not to mention the accompanying media frenzy _ directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first witness on Thursday.
Mrs Tripp's tape-recorded phone calls of Ms Lewinsky discussing a planned cover-up of her affair with Clinton are the focal point of a probe by a Maryland prosecutor of whether she broke the state wiretapping law.
Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.
Fifty-six percent of those polled believe Linda Tripp's main motivation in secretly taping her conversations with Ms Monica Lewinsky was to get attention or make money through a book deal.
He is investigating whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
