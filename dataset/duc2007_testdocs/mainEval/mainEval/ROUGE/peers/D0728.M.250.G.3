China has started to put into mass production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat liver diseases.
Can be given orally and are well-tolerated.
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20% of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
But it is expensive, it poses serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who take it.
While interferon alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or stroke.
Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects.
One, led by researchers at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin was 31 to 38% effective among patients being treated for the first time.
John G. McHutchison of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California, compared the effects of the combination with interferon alone in the initial treatment of 912 patients.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20% of patients.
