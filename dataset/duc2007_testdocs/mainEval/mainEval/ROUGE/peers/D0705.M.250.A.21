ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.
After that incident, Herri Batasuna, the political party linked to the armed separatist group ETA, said for the first time that the party opposed street violence as a way to further the Basque separatist cause.
_ The armed Basque separatist movement ETA accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the Basque language.
But when asked Wednesday about the possibility of an ETA cease-fire, Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said, ``It would be a trick truce''.
ETA, the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
The radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion said it had received a statement from ETA in which the separatist group announced a truce in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in the north of Spain, the state-run news agency EFE reported.
_ A former leader of the Basque separatist group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace talks.
_ Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group ETA.
