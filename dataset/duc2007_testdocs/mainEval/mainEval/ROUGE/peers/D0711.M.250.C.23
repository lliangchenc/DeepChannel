The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market for personal computer software.
A lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it ``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case.'' The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.
An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
The Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
