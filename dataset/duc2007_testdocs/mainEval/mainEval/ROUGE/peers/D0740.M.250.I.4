After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt smoothly Sunday morning.
It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types of balloons: helium and hot air.
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon landed gently at 08:03 local time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the Kakhla Oasis 485 kilometers southwest of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1.
For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to charities.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
The air, heated by propane burners, keeps the helium from contracting at night, helping the balloon to maintain altitude.
