Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools.
Inner City Arts, founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and English language instruction to students from public elementary schools _ largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing industries.
Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools who attend classes twice a week for six weeks.
Steel drum has gained momentum in the city's public schools, which received $25 million last September from the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to restore arts and music programs that were cut several years ago.
Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being slashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the country.
The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about the importance of music education.
Fewer than 3 percent of seniors take out-of-school classes in music, art or dance, compared with more than 11 percent of sophomores.
Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative writing.
For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and theaters for lessons in art, music and dance.
