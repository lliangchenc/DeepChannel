On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
The European Union on Monday welcomed a move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
Controversial British author Salman Rushdie says he has been hurt and humiliated by the country of his birth, India, which treated him as a persona non grata and his next novel is about saying good-bye to the country, Press Trust of India reported Saturday.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties with the European Union.
Iran declared here today that it will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989, claiming ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
