Ngo said the drought has bad impact on agricultural production not only in this year but also in the next few years.
He said the Mekong river water level is very low now, measured at two meters early this month, the lowest level since 1926.
If the drought persists, a shortage of water for power generation and cultivation will be unavoidable, Ngo added.
To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand, Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj.
Mamloo dam will harness more than 200 million cubic meters of river water and turn it to drinking and irrigation water, he added.
Construction of Mamloo dam and the power plant, which will be completed by the year 2001, will cost 180 billion rials (about 60 million U.S. dollars).
The ministry is studying the feasibility of building 15 dams and 16 hill ponds to collect rain water during the winter for use in the dry month of summer.
Qmeir said construction on four dams could begin in 2000.
He promised the ministry annual budget of around 40 million U.S. dollars would cover the cost.
Sources in the authority said that they have further reduced water supply in a bid to use the reservoir for as many days as possible.
