Peru, with its resurgent gold industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries, according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to Thailand.
Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
