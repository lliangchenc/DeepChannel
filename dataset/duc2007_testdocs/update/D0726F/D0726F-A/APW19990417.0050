	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Recalling an uncle who suffered poison  
gas exposure in World War I, Vice President Al Gore said his family 
is ``one of millions that knows firsthand'' about the Balkans' role 
in world stability.

<P>
	``Will the 21st century be shaped and molded by thugs in ski  
masks with weapons in their hands and hatred in their hearts? The 
answer given by the people of the United States of America is no,'' 
Gore said Friday night at his first Tennessee fund-raiser for the 
2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw midway through this century the moral consequences of  
crimes against humanity that occurred with much of the world 
standing by, not doing much of anything about it,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 450 Democratic supporters gathered at a  
$1,000-per-plate dinner, Gore promised to get Kosovar refugees 
``back to their homes, with security and with justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is expected to spend this weekend campaigning in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hasn't officially announced his campaign for the 2000  
Democratic nomination, but has raised $8.9 million, according to 
the Federal Election Commission.
