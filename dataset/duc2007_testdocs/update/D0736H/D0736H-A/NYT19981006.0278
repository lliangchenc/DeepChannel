   &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's at the top of her form right now: Her movie,
``Beloved,'' is about to open, she's the richest and most
influential woman in entertainment, she's celebrated as a proponent
of reading and all things bright and beautiful, and she's on the
cover of the latest Vogue, looking terrific.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the story of her humble beginnings, her rise to
stardom, her longtime romance, her crash diets, weight regain and
much-admired, sensible decision to give up dieting in favor of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe being queen of the TV world isn't enough. Vogue's
 &UR; Anna Wintour &LR;  exults in the editor's note at the front of the Oprah
issue that the magazine staff was thrilled ``when we heard that
Oprah Winfrey wanted to be made glamorous. She knew she had to lose
weight, but she has done that before, and she promised she would
lose 20 pounds by our deadline. She did. ... Our fashion editor
said that she was so moved by the Polaroids taken during the shoot
that she went to her dressing room to be alone and came out with
moist eyes. There's something reassuring in the fact that Oprah,
one of the most powerful women in America, should nurture her own
dreams of perfect beauty and allure _ just like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Our instant minipoll of five women found that 100 percent found
nothing at all reassuring about it. A one-word description of their
assessment: bummer.

   &UR; ANOTHER DIETER MAKES GOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the premiere of her TV talk show, the  &UR; Duchess &LR; 
 &UR; of York &LR;  promised that she would be good. ``I'm not going to be
saying anything wrong or bad about the royal family,'' she told the
Telegraph of London.
</P>
<P>
   The show will focus on people, like herself, who have suffered.
``I want to talk to real, proper people who've been through hell,''
she said. ``People like my friend Irene, who lost her daughter at
14 through drugs. What was that like for her? I can think of
nothing worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know. I would hate it if my children took drugs or
got leukemia, so if I can help by spreading the word, it might ease
the drug situation or encourage people to give bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's first show featured a hit-and-run driver and a rape
victim; the second was about anorexia, the third about cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess dedicated Monday's program to the memory of her
mother, who recently died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Life in public isn't easy for her, she told the Telegraph.
``People who know me say `poor you' because they know I'm actually
a shy person. Not many people realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Elsewhere in the Chat-for-Hire empire,  &UR; Marie Osmond &LR; , who has
a new talk show, promotes it Friday with an appearance on the Food
Network, in which she tells host  &UR; Bill Boggs &LR;  of her suspicions
that  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  knew what was going on. ``Please,'' pleaded
Osmond. ``I'm a woman. Let's talk.'')

   _ Start reading now if you want to be hip: The inside pick for
this year's Nobel Prize for Literature, says the New York Post (as
much an authority on literature as is the New York Review of Books
on action flicks), is  &UR; Bill Auld &LR; , a retired Scottish schoolteacher
who has written 52 books of poetry in Esperanto.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several readers noted that a stamp honoring the circus had
featured a living person, clown  &UR; Lou Jacobs &LR; ; and  &UR; Jeremy Klein &LR; 
said that the stamp featuring the Iwo Jima monument in Washington,
based on  &UR; Joe Rosenthal &LR; 's war photo, included images of living
people, too. And this is not to mention moon-walker
 &UR; Neil Armstrong. T.S. &LR;   &UR; Bolton &LR; , who takes the Postal Service
seriously, is reeling from the news that Superman is dead.

   _ Watching the UCLA football game on TV over the weekend, &UR; Al &LR; 
 &UR; Guthertz &LR;  didn't feel exactly festive observing the moment of
silence in memory of  &UR; Florence Griffith Joyner &LR; , which was
described by the TV commentator as ``part of the halftime
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Supreme Court Justice  &UR; Joseph Teresi  &LR; has denied  &UR; Al &LR; 
 &UR; Lewis &LR; , who played Grandpa on ``The Munsters'' and is running as
the Green Party candidate for governor of New York, the right to
use the word ``Grandpa'' with his name on the ballot.

also a lot of really bad songs I've written that you never hear.''
