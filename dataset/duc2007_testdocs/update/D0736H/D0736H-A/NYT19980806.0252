 &HT;    Springer brings show back to it's violent ways
 &HT;    By Bob Longino

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Jerry Springer knows how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   As he promised he would do if a kinder, gentler ``Jerry
Springer'' suffered in the ratings, daytime's hardest hitting
slugger brought his talk show back to the brink of violence in
July. The result: Nielsen ratings, which dropped significantly for
the toned-down ``Springer,'' went back up in metro Atlanta as soon
as the guest confrontations got uglier.
</P>
<P>
   The return to violence helped ``Springer'' claw its way to a
virtual tie with one-time giant ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in July
ratings as metro Atlanta's most-watched daytime talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 145,000 area households tuned in to both shows on
average during July. While that was a 21 percent drop in viewership
for ``Springer'' compared to the recent May sweeps, it was still
enough to match ``Oprah,'' whose ratings remained virtually
unchanged from May and from July a year ago.

   Poll on Tailwind
</P>
<P>
   Americans see CNN's retraction of its Operation Tailwind story
as part of an overall decline in the media's accuracy, according to
a poll to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted July 29-Aug. 2 by telephone of 1,189 adults,
found that 49 percent were aware of CNN's retraction of its
``NewsStand'' story, which alleged nerve gas use by the U.S.
military. Asked if Tailwind was an ``isolated incident'' or if
``the news media as a whole is generally less accurate these
days,'' 55 percent said they are less accurate overall, and 31 said
Tailwind was isolated, with 14 percent not responding.
</P>
<P>
   The research center has also been tracking for three years
whether the public thinks news organizations are generally
accurate, and finds a steady decline, from 55 percent in 1985 to 34
percent in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.
