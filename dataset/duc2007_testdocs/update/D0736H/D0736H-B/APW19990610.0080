<HEADLINE> TBS To Launch Women's Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Broadcasting System is teaming up with  
two major magazine publishers to launch a cable television channel 
aimed at women, going up against the already successful Lifetime 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new channel, which has yet to be named, will be launched  
together with an accompanying Web site early next year, the 
companies announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS' partners in the venture are Time Inc., which like TBS is  
part of the Time Warner media conglomerate, and Conde Nast, which 
is owned by the privately held company Advance Publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service will be headed by Pat Mitchell, who heads the  
production division at CNN that won a Peabody award for its series 
on the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women represent the fastest-growing Internet population and a  
television audience that remains underserved,'' she said. ``The new 
network will provide a destination exclusively for smart, active 
women seeking relevant content and community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not release information about specific  
programs, but they said the new channel would draw material from 
style, entertaining, travel, food and parenting articles in the 
various magazines published by Conde Nast and Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast publishes Mademoiselle, Vogue, Bride's, Glamour and  
other magazines. Time Inc.'s titles include People, InStyle, 
Parenting, Health and Food &AMP; Wine. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture would face competition from the successful  
Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., 
as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk 
show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving 
forces behind the success of Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
	While the success of Lifetime could bode well for other channels  
aimed at women, entertainment industry analysts said it was not yet 
clear that there was room for all three. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly enough topics to be dealt with, but the  
question is whether there's enough advertising to support three 
networks in the same area,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at 
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``It's just too soon to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said she thought there was plenty of room for  
programming aimed at women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lifetime and Oxygen are different from what we're offering.  
Women are half of the viewing population, and there's not only room 
for three or more services targeting women but there's a need for 
it,'' she said.
