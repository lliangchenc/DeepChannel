   1939: In April, regularly scheduled network TV is born when NBC
airs President Franklin D. Roosevelt's speech at the opening of the
New York World's Fair. With few people able to afford a TV set, the
event is hardly a ratings blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   1947: NBC's first broadcast of baseball's World Series draws a
large audience and overnight turns the sport into ``America's
pastime.'' Even more significantly, it starts a run on TV sets,
which until then were never expected to supplant radio. Today, the
average American family owns three TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   1960: The televised presidential debate between Richard Nixon
and John F. Kennedy illustrates the power of image. Viewers watch
as a sweaty Nixon looks pale and inexperienced next to the calm,
good-looking Kennedy. Candidates begin to respect TV's power.
</P>
<P>
   1963: John F. Kennedy's assassination is massively covered by
network television, becoming the first major breaking TV news
tragedy. Blanket coverage is now a staple of television news, and
with so many channels and so little news, the events deemed worthy
of such coverage are of much less significance than the murder of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   1968: Dressed in flak jackets and military helmets, Walter
Cronkite and other TV journalists file nightly dispatches from the
front lines of the Vietnam War, bringing home the horror while
helping shift public sentiment against America's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   1970: Phil Donahue debuts with a daytime show on which everyday
people discuss everyday topics, and the talk show genre is born.
The success of ``Donahue'' makes room for Oprah Winfrey, who takes
her Chicago-based talk show national. Later, however, the genre is
severely exploited, morphing into ``trash'' TV talk shows with
hosts like Geraldo Rivera, whose chair-throwing exhibitions
precedes an even sleazier profit-monger named Jerry Springer, a
former Cincinnati mayor.
</P>
<P>
   1970s: ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Maude,'' ``All in the Family'' and
``Sanford &AMP; Son'' usher in a new kind of situation comedy built
around red-flag issues such as interfaith marriage, abortion and
war. These open the door for variety shows such as ``Saturday Night
Live'' to delve into political satire. Comedy would diminish in the
late '70s and early '80s, only to be revived by ``The Cosby Show''
in 1984. Now the cycle has dipped again, with sitcoms attracting
fewer viewers than ever.
</P>
<P>
   1980: On Nov. 21, more than 80 million viewers tune in to see
who shot ruthless character J.R. Ewing in the prime-time soap
``Dallas.'' Producers have been trying to duplicate such dramatic
suspense since then, with cliffhangers and special episodes of
drama on sitcoms. But with today's fragmented audience, the
top-rated program on TV, ``ER,'' tops out at 35 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   1980s: Cable slowly but successfully becomes an alternative to
network television. But it also eliminates the universal language
of TV. Now everyone's speaking a different tongue: kids, blacks,
Hispanics, computer geeks, Martha Stewart wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   1997: Billions of viewers around the world watch Princess
Diana's funeral. It helps Elton John's eulogy song top ``White
Christmas'' as the all-time bestseller and, more significantly,
illustrates how the medium few believed in at first is now a
trusted, ubiquitous presence.
