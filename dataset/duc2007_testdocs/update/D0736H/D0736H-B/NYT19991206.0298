   Sherry Lansing, chairwoman of Paramount's motion picture group
since 1992, has replaced Oprah Winfrey as the most powerful woman
in the entertainment business, according to an annual trade
publication due out today.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lansing's reign, Paramount has popularized the concept of
co-financing many of its big-budget films. The studio finished a
close second to Disney last year in market share and ranks fourth
in 1999 share after Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal, with hits
like ``Runaway Bride,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' and ``The General's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansing finished second in The Hollywood Reporter's ranking last
year, compiled annually as part of a ``Women in Entertainment:
Power 50'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry has more green-light power than any other woman in film
and her studio has had a pretty good year,'' said Randy Tierney,
special issues editorial director at The Reporter. ``She's in great
control there. The fact that she's been there for so long
definitely factors into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reporter named Universal Pictures Chairwoman Stacey Snider
as No.2 on its list, noting that Lansing and Snider are the only
two women single-handedly running motion picture studios. ``There's
a lot of instant power in being the head of a studio,'' Tierney
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Snider, a three-year veteran of Universal who was ranked 19th
last year, became co-chairwoman in June as the studio was ending
its long box office slump with ``The Mummy,'' ``Notting Hill'' and
``American Pie.'' She assumed sole chairwomanship last month when
Brian Mulligan departed.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney pointed out that the list _ based on position, how much
money they control and success in the marketplace of their products
_ reflected a generally strong upward shift among women executives
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Sherry Lansing anymore,'' he said. ``There has
been a huge upward movement within the past year-and-a-half to two
years. It looks as if the business has been opting for the best
person (instead of the best man) because there's definitely been a
lot of movement that has broken the inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased power among female executives is the key reason
why Winfrey's ranking slid from first to 19th, according to
Tierney. ``It's not as if Oprah isn't hugely successful, but the
dynamics have changed,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, chairwoman of Chicago-based Harpo Entertainment Group,
also saw her ranking fall due to a below-expectations performance
by ``Beloved,'' in which she starred, and a slight decline in the
overall clout of the talk-show business.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing in a tie for third place were Lucy Fisher, vice
chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and Amy
Pascal, president of Columbia Pictures. Sony ranks sixth in
domestic box office with ``Big Daddy'' as the only hit but it has
high hopes for the soon-to-be-released ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music executive Michele Anthony finished fourth, followed
by ABC Television Network President Patricia Fili-Krushel, CBS
Entertainment President Nancy Tellem and Universal Pictures
distribution Chairwoman Nikki Rocco.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said he expects more upward movement among female
executives, which should lead to more opportunities for women in
acting, writing and directing. ``The numbers are still very low in
some areas so I think you're going to see more openings,'' he
added.
