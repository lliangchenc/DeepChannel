<HEADLINE> Oprah Copyright Suit To Go on Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing Oprah Winfrey of using
copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book will go to trial next
month, a federal judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ruben Castillo this week issued an opinion saying
photographers Paul Natkin and Stephen Green own the copyright on 11
pictures in the book. But the judge said only a trial can decide
whether Winfrey was licensed to put them in ''Make the Connection:
Ten Steps to a Better Body and Better Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey claims she paid the photographers more than $250,000 for
the license to use the pictures not only in the book, but anywhere
she wants.
</P>
<P>
   Natkin and Green said the money allowed Winfrey to put the
photos in publicity packages for her TV talk show but not in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey was out of the country and unavailable for comment
Wednesday. But attorney Charles Babcock said she likely would be on
hand for the trial and take the stand herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's face it,'' he said. ''She'll make an awfully strong
witness.''
