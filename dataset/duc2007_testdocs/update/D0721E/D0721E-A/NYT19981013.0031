WYOMING DEATH ECHOES RISING ANTI-GAY ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE HERSCHER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ The death of a gay University of Wyoming
student who was savagely bludgeoned and left lashed to a fence
comes at a time of growing rhetoric and violence against gays.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, 21, died early Monday after being in a coma for
nearly a week. He had been robbed, beaten and pistol-whipped in the
head so severely his skull was too crushed for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The father of one of two accused suspects said his son told him
he committed the crime because he was embarrassed when Shepard
flirted with him in front of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gay violence and even deaths are not new. But Shepard's
killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians
nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing. Shepard
lost his life at a time when describing homosexuality as a sickness
that needs curing is gaining political currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be
dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals,''
said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York. ``His attackers are among millions of
Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not
worthy of the most basic equal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian right, led by the Center for Reclaiming America in
Fort Lauderdale, last summer bought a series of ads in major
newspapers claiming that love and religious teaching will ``cure''
homosexuality. The group plans to air similar television ads soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told a
television interviewer that homosexuality is a sin and that gay
people should be helped ``just like alcohol or sex addiction . . .
or kleptomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 states, including California, have hate crime laws that
include sexual orientation. In Wyoming, three attempts to pass such
laws have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian and gay activists say that although polls show that most
Americans favor nondiscrimination, their support can erode when
laws don't protect gays, political leaders call them sinful and
religious organizations say they can change if only they tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no stronger testament to how toxic the
environment is that has been created by the extreme right than what
happened to Matthew Shepard,'' said Kate Kendell of the National
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ``It is crystal clear
to lesbians and gay men in this country that hate rhetoric is
directly linked to this kind of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are not yet available for 1998, but hate crimes
against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people increased
nationally by 2 percent in 1997. In high schools and colleges,
violence against gays and lesbians gay youth increased a dramatic
34 percent, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence
Programs. The increases appear to be a combination of both a jump
in actual crimes as well as a growing readiness to report attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In another study released earlier this year by the University of
Washington, one in 10 community college students admitted to
committing hate crimes against gays. Some interviewed said an
unwanted advance or flirtation was a legitimate reason for an
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much more it's going to take for the right to
recognize their vitriolic rhetoric takes on actively violent
overtones in the hands of certain individuals in this country,''
Kendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming
America, called the young man's death ``reprehensible'' and said
the ads were not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main cause of the increase in violence in this country is
our having removed moral absolutes from our society and turning
away from what God would have us do,'' Folger said. ``When certain
elements in our society advocate that everyone should do what they
want to do, without any consideration of God's laws, our society
will regretfully become more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San
Francisco. At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag
was lowered to half-staff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno spoke
briefly about the need for ending hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrown into relief what I call the jihad against the gay
community,'' Ammiano said, ``from Trent Lott to those ads to the
fights against gay marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, voters in Alaska and Hawaii will be asked to change
their state constitutions to keep same-sex couples from marrying.
In March 2000, if a ballot petition submitted last month qualifies,
Californians will vote on a law that bars gay marriages.
