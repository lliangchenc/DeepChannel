<HEADLINE> Teen Identifies McKinney in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney, accused of the fatal  
beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard, pulled out a gun 
and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked, a 
teen-ager testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Herrera, 19, said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano  
Morales III when McKinney went to his truck, pulled out a gun and 
hit Morales from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a thud. It was the most sickening thing I ever heard  
in my life,'' said Herrera, who added he struck McKinney with a 
thick stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard's  
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery. If  
convicted, he faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first full day of testimony, jurors also heard from  
the coroner who examined Shepard's body, a bartender and Morales, 
who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to  
kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney and Henderson kidnapped Shepard and  
took him to a remote area near Laramie on Oct. 7, 1998 and lashed 
him to a fence, where they robbed him of $20. Shepard was beaten 
into a coma. He died five days later.
