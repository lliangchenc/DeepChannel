SECOND TRIAL UNDER WAY IN DEATH OF GAY MAN

   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the
University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage''
because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that
reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child,
McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began
here.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale
for the killing from Cal Rerucha, the prosecutor for Albany County,
who said that McKinney and a friend, Russell Henderson, fully
intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of
$20. For that, prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for
McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death
penalty. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no
chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted wide attention. Shepard, 21, was beaten more
than 20 times on the head with a .357-magnum handgun, tied to a
fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die. He was found by
a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital, where he lived
only four more days.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a rallying cry for states and the federal
government to pass and expand hate-crime measures, but fewer than
half the states have passed such measures, and Wyoming remains one
of eight states with no hate-crime laws. Federal lawmakers last
week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the
definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the case appeared to stir much interest in Laramie. The
spacious courtroom was far from filled. Shepard's mother, Judy, sat
with several friends opposite several of McKinney's relatives,
including his father, Bill McKinney. Otherwise, the audience was
made up of mostly reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's
court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for
Shepard's death. But in mounting a defense designed to bring a
prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's
past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts
of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking
heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at
a local bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual
orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and
that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman
argued that McKinney was ``haunted by a past, that put him into a
rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important. If prosecutors can prove malicious
intent and premeditation, they have a better chance of winning a
death sentence. If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved
from a moment of passion or rage, they may persuade the jury to
find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge, like manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case, it might be
difficult to win a death sentence. Wyoming is one of 38 states that
have a death penalty but one of the least inclined to use it. Since
the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment was
constitutional, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado and Ohio each have put to
death only one prisoner. Wyoming has only two inmates on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6, 1998,
from the Fireside Lounge, where McKinney and Henderson encountered
Shepard, to the beatings, which began as the two drove Shepard
around town and continued at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tangeman's version, Shepard was portrayed as a sexual
predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had ``reached
over and grabbed Aaron's genitals and licked his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very,
very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a
sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Tangeman said the older boy threatened to spread the word that
McKinney was a homosexual. Also, Tangeman said, McKinney at 15 had
a consensual sexual encounter with a male cousin.
