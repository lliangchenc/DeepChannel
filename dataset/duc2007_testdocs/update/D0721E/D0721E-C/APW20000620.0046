<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Hate-Crimes Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fresh prodding from President Clinton,
the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate
crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate
crime charges.
</P>
<P>
   But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by
the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate
over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd,
a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and
the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., the principal sponsor. ''They tear at the heart
and soul of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an
amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his
appeal for Senate passage. He also put in a few calls to wavering
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different
and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton
said. ''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family. We have
to pass this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate
crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman, was
pressing a rival approach that would set up a $5 million-a-year
fund at the Justice Department to help state and local authorities
investigate and prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal also would authorize a federal study to see whether
hate crimes were not being prosecuted by state and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the Kennedy measure was overly broad. For instance,
he suggested that under it every rape prosecution could be deemed a
hate crime and prosecuted in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate
crimes is warranted,'' Hatch said. ''Serious constitutional
questions remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem facing the Kennedy measure: Senate
Republican leaders are wary of further weighing down the defense
bill with irrelevant amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are seeking to use the legislation to press a range of
high profile issues in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser, said Kennedy was optimistic
the measure would be approved, although he suggested the vote could
be close.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adopted the hate-crimes legislation last year as part
of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments,
but it stalled in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure would expand a 1968 federal law that defines
hate crimes as assaults motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin as the victim attempts to exercise
certain specified federally protected activities -- including voting
or attending school.
</P>
<P>
   His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The underlying defense bill is S. 2549
