TURNING A MURDER CASE INTO A THEATRICAL EVENT

   DENVER _ Matt Galloway talks in sporadic, sometimes emotional
bursts. His hands fly around. His body tries to keep up. At least
that is how Stephen Belber portrayed him onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned that at first,'' the real Galloway said after
watching ``The Laramie Project,'' a new play by Moises Kaufman of
the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project, which had its premiere
here on Saturday night. ``But I guess I really do talk like that.
It was pretty accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway
was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months
ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him,
robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts
of town _ all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the
University of Wyoming, was gay.
</P>
<P>
   After five days in a Colorado hospital, Shepard died. The
roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The serendipity of Galloway's role in Shepard's life, as well as
the relationships that scores of others had with Shepard, have been
woven into an emotional performance, drawn from court records,
personal journals and 200 interviews in Laramie conducted by
Kaufman, his writers and his actors. ``The Laramie Project''
examines homophobia, class distinctions and cowboy culture by
blending the chronology of the case with the anger, confusion,
sadness and embarrassment it left behind. The play ultimately
questions whether Laramie, or the nation, has changed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The words of more than 60 people are conveyed by eight actors
simulating the appearance, mannerisms and speech patterns of the
people they interviewed. Kaufman, 36, who wrote the critically
acclaimed play ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar
Wilde,'' said his new play represented an effort to use the stage
as a journalistic medium.
</P>
<P>
   And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting
nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and
television reporters who face daily deadlines. Kaufman even breaks
a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy
sheriff who first reached Shepard at the fence, learned later that
the victim was HIV positive and feared that her efforts to
resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS. She
began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.
</P>
<P>
   But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay
man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play
reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a
university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in
political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist
minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during
the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to
reflect on his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the
Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage
who attended the opening performance. In an interview, he said the
Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including
those of friends of his who no longer use the word ``fag'' to
describe a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he recalled two customers coming into the
Fireside last week, asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the
bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments. Galloway
said he was repulsed by the request.
</P>
<P>
   Zackie Salmon, 52, who manages a scholarship program at the
university, was briefly portrayed onstage, expressing repugnance at
one of the killers, Aaron J. McKinney. As a lesbian, she said, she
has noticed that the death of Shepard has had some salutary effects
on Laramie's gay and lesbian population, which is larger than most
gays and lesbians there had ever realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this incident, I would have never felt as comfortable
being who I am,'' Salmon said. ``After the Matthew Shepard
incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to
face what happened in our community and we're going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Salmon added, she has a lesbian friend who works in
a different department at the university who has told her that she
fears she could lose her job if her sexual orientation were made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still won't walk across the street holding my partner's
hand,'' she said. ``I would do that in New York and I've done it in
San Francisco. But I still won't do it in Laramie.''
