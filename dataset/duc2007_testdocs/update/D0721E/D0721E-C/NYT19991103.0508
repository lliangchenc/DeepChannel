   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 4:

   The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming
who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked
Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery. A jury
has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery
in the case, and he could face the death penalty. The other
defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and
kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Although McKinney admitted that he had committed the attack, his
lawyers hoped to raise a type of ``gay panic'' defense. In their
opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of
manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to
respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances. The
presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as
inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a
diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which
is allowed under Wyoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has
been invoked in other cases. Typically, the argument is that the
attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes
so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is
provoked to kill the victim. In other words, the attacker should
not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own
homophobia. Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be
tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should
not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about
McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty
phase of the case. Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in
sentencing deliberations. But that is quite a different matter from
allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense
for criminal acts.
