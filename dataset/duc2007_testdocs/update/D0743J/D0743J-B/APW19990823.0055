<HEADLINE> Turkish Industry Survives Quake </HEADLINE>

	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- The car-repair shop where Cihan Cakiroglu  
worked is twisted wreckage, his boss is dead, and the August 
paycheck thatis now homeless family needs will never come. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby Goodyear tire plant, the blue steel walls still  
stand, but most of the employees are too busy searching for 
relatives or shelter for their families to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive,  
7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial 
heartland early Tuesday. The social and economic costs appear to be 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homeless people like Cakiroglu are demanding that  
the government help them buy new homes and furniture and find them 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say each day remaining factories like the Goodyear plant  
remain idle leads to a loss of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, already struggling to cut back a federal budget  
deficit, is strapped for the cash needed to repair basic 
infrastructure, including roads, bridges and electrical lines. And 
the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the 
government will have even less income to count on. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to the economy could top $20 billion -- 10 percent of  
the country's gross national product and enough to drag the country 
back into recession, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage  
to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the 
history of Turkey has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulent Akgerman, head of the Aegean Young Businessmen  
Association, has suggested a six-day work week to overcome the 
impact of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industrialists are demanding aid from the international  
community, which has already provided $500 million in loans and 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it smoothly if we  
receive support from international organizations,'' said Tevfik 
Aksoy, chief economist of Istanbul's Bank Ekspres. ``I seriously 
doubt that Turkey will be left alone on this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire  
factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have 
been left largely undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to reopen soon, which will no doubt help ease  
the strain of the earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodyear plant in Izmit, for example, was built with steel  
walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and 
buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager Mehmet 
Turkel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some equipment was damaged, he said, but the plant should be  
able to reopen quickly, and its 500 employees should return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come here in a week, you'll see this plant running,''  
he said. ``People want it to happen.'' But the plant will wait a 
few days more for the search for survivors and possessions to end. 
Five of the plant's workers are believed to have been killed in the 
quake, and almost half have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Personnel manager Harun Savas said the plant is offering tea and  
sandwiches to workers who come in to help assess damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start a new life,'' said Savas, who pulled the  
bodies of five of his relatives from the wreckage of their homes 
and later helped bury them. 
</P>
<P>
	His house survived the earthquake, but his 12-year-old son,  
Cagdas, was too frightened to stay in Izmit and has gone with 
Savas' wife and daughter to live with relatives on the Black Sea 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the major problem will be how to get people back to  
work,'' said Haluk Tukel, the secretary-general of TUSIAD, the 
country's leading organization of industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.  
</P>
<P>
	In a grassy lot in front of a 50-foot pile of rubble, Cakiroglu  
stood beside his new home -- a brown blanket held up by a few sticks 
of wood. It is here that he sleeps with his wife and 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to do anything, even sell pretzels on the  
street,'' Cakiroglu said.
