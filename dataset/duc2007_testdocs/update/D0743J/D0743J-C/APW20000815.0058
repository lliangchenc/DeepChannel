<HEADLINE> Many Homeless Year After Turk Quake  </HEADLINE>

   IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- It has been a year since Ayse Karatas
grabbed her 3-year-old granddaughter, wrenched open a window and
jumped out of her apartment building to escape a shattering
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Since surviving the quake, Karatas and her family have been
living in a tent donated by the U.S. government and using a nearby
garden hose to fill jugs with water for drinking and washing.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some 26,000 survivors of the Aug. 17, 1999, quake that
devastated Turkey's industrial heartland are living in tent cities.
An additional 150,000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes
that are oppressively hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing,'' said Karatas, as she sat outside her green
tent sucking on an ice cube in the stifling heat. ''The state
doesn't care about us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude
earthquake destroyed poorly built apartment houses, crushing some
17,000 people as they slept. The quake virtually leveled parts of
Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But anger is fading toward a government that at first appeared
ineffective and slow to react. People no longer question whether
the state is still there to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of rescue efforts led by the military, the most
respected Turkish institution, is dissipating and the Turkish press
rarely mentions the thousands of people like Karatas, the wife of a
retired baker, who are too poor to find their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad, but it seems that they are an afterthought,'' said
Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Turkish response to the disaster was so
disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to ask civilians for
advice on where to go. But Turks feel their government has handled
the post-quake cleanup well.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in tent cities has fallen from some 120,000
after the quake to 26,000 today and the government expects that
number to decline sharply in the coming months. The cash-strapped
state gives some 56,000 families $155 a month in rent subsidies and
has provided free meals to some 195,000 survivors for most of the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   When a second, much smaller quake struck in November, the
government and the military reacted quickly. Relief teams were
dispatched and, although almost 1,000 people died in that quake,
the rescue efforts appeared to be well coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to be a statement that the government has learned
its lesson,'' Makovsky said. ''I think that the government has
recouped its honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also received a boost when the European Union in
December agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership,
bringing the country one step closer to its long cherished goal of
integration with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The government has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new
quake, which seismologists warn could happen at any time.
</P>
<P>
   In Izmit, the hard-hit town where Karatas lives, mobile rescue
teams are prepared for deployment within four hours of a disaster.
A quake coordination headquarters has been built in a field, far
from any tall buildings. Government officials have walkie-talkies
in their offices so that they can be reached if phone lines are
cut.
</P>
<P>
   For new buildings, inspections and insurance will be required,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready,'' says Muhammet Uygun, deputy disaster area
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But that news is of little help to Karatas. Although the state
gives rent credits to people whose apartments were destroyed,
Karatas had no lease and was unable to prove that she had been
renting an apartment in the quake zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband receives a pension of $155 a month, rents
have skyrocketed since the earthquake, which damaged more than
100,000 homes in her home province of Kocaeli alone. A small
apartment would cost the family's entire monthly income.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state doesn't care about us,'' Karatas said as her eyes
turned red and swelled with tears. ''They would rather we die.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an anger that newly confident officials dismiss with
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our citizens are a bit ungrateful,'' Uygun said. ''They always
want something else no matter what you give them.''
