   IZMIT, Turkey _ On a stretch of grassy promenade in front of the
Sea of Marmara, the Meckeli family has built a living room of
sorts, with an overstuffed couch, matching chairs and a small
coffee table holding warm cans of soda.
</P>
<P>
   Their real apartment was made unlivable by the earthquake that
devastated a huge part of Turkey's industrialized region. And now,
like so many others living out in the open air, the Meckelis are
trying to hold on to a semblance of their old life while they wait
for the government to help them build a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we made it out alive, but sooner
or later somebody has to tell us what's going to happen to us, how
long will we be out here, will we ever get any money for our
losses?'' said Ismail Meckeli, a married factory worker with two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks after the earthquake, which killed more than
13,000 people and left at least 200,000 homeless, officials are
struggling to come up with a plan to provide housing for quake
survivors who often lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Netherlands have promised prefabricated housing to
ensure that the homeless get out of tent camps by the start of
winter. Other countries have donated money and supplies to help
people get through the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   This is a temporary measure, until the government organizes a
program for rebuilding the 10,000 buildings _ 60,000 apartments _
that collapsed or that were seriously damaged in the 45-second
earthquake that hit Turkey's most industrialized region.
</P>
<P>
   A state minister and government spokesman, Sukru Sina Gurel,
said last week that Turkey planned to provide free housing to those
who had lost their homes, but added that it would be more than a
year before everyone was permanently rehoused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we also have to consider establishing some new
residential areas, because some places were perhaps built on areas
that are too prone to serious earthquake damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering experts warn that before construction starts, Turkey
must put together stronger rules to ensure that buildings can
withstand quakes in this temblor-prone region.
</P>
<P>
   Many engineers say that lax building codes, and unscrupulous
contractors and politicians, contributed to the disaster by
allowing substandard buildings on fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson from this earthquake about how things
should be built, and now the issue is that we want to ensure that
standards are met and that the government institutes necessary laws
for this,'' said Murat Celik, chairman of the Modern Lawyer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association is one of several groups trying to sue the
government _ from Turkey's president to Istanbul officials _ for
not ensuring that buildings were constructed according to
earthquake standards.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also might help survivors to get compensation.
Because home insurance is rare, and contractors are not required to
carry insurance, few of those who lost their homes can count on
being recompensed for their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated costs to Turkey from the earthquake range from $4.5
billion, for the loss in production, to about $17 billion for the
added damage to apartment buildings and the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross
domestic product loss, or ``negative growth.'' But business groups
say the economy should start bouncing back by the year 2001, partly
because of the construction boom that the earthquake has
necessitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the human tragedy is foremost in people's mind,''
said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of TUSIAD, the country's main
industrialists' association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we would expect a great deal of economic activity over the
next two to four years because of the reconstruction,'' Yucaoglu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also expecting loans and grants to help it shoulder
the burden of rehousing people and restoring damaged
infrastructure. Water lines are still down in most of the quake-hit
region, electricity is just being turned back on, and roads and
bridges need repair.
</P>
<P>
   A team of US engineering experts was in the region surveying the
damage to make recommendations on how Turkey can house people,
given constraints of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is how many of the damaged buildings _ some of which
were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment
_ need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put a man on the moon but at what cost?'' said Roger
Sullivan, sent as part of Washington's assistance program to Turkey
after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an engineering standpoint it's easier to knock down a
building and start again than try and reinforce, but it's tough to
tell people that you're going to wipe out their structure where all
their savings went,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups are not waiting for help from the government,
which was accused by many of being slow to react after the
earthquake. Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to
distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit
area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up
their own tent camps.
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and
worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for
temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which
nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while
governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pakmaya yeast factory in Izmit, a private company that
exports to 100 countries, officials said they were preparing to
break ground to build 80 housing units for workers who lost their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees contributed to our earnings over the years, and
now it's our turn to share these gains with our workers,'' said
Tuncay Yurdesin, factory manager.
