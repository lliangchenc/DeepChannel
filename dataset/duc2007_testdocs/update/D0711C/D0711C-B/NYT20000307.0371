MICROSOFT QUITS TRADE GROUP AFTER DISPUTE OVER ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Microsoft Corp. quit the nation's oldest and largest software
industry trade association Tuesday after a long-running dispute
over the group's support for the government in the Microsoft
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly
known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice
Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal
computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because
the company believed that the software trade association had become
totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on
other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked
directly against Microsoft on competition issues.'' But, he said,
``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some
other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made
sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of
disagreement.'' Herbold, a member of the association's board, added
that Microsoft had come to believe that was no longer true.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery reply, Ken Wasch, the group's president, said that by
quitting, ``Microsoft has again proven that their tactics resemble
that of a schoolyard bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade group's board voted two years ago to support the
government in the antitrust case, Wasch said its relationship with
Microsoft had been ``a difficult one, much like the U.S.
relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter of resignation, Herbold said the group was
increasingly ineffective and that its membership was ``sagging.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasch replied that the Software and Information Industry
Association was ``thriving.'' Microsoft paid membership fees of
$125,000 a year. The trade group's annual budget is about $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock jumped more than 5 percent at one point
Tuesday after a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst, Rick Sherlund,
released a research memo suggesting that settlement talks with the
government in the antitrust case ``may be heating up.'' The stock
price fell back to $92.875, an increase of 2.48 percent, by the
close of the regular trading day.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of the antitrust suit has pushed Microsoft's share
price down 25 percent from its 52-week high in recent weeks despite
the introduction of its Windows 2000 operating system in February.
