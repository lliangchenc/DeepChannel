<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit
leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its
25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's holding that Microsoft is a
monopoly that abused its power and harmed consumers raises the
possibility that the US Justice Department might demand the
corporate equivalent of the death penalty _ the dismantling of
Microsoft _ after the manner of Standard Oil Co.'s 1911 breakup.
Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Friday would
not rule out this Draconian penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Microsoft avoids action of this magnitude, years of
tough legal battles lie ahead, with a potential to sap the firm's
ability to keep up with its competitors. And those competitors can
use Friday's ruling to make life even tougher for Microsoft.
Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of
Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust
actions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a disaster for Microsoft,'' said Thane Scott, head
of the antitrust practice at Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
``Based on these documents alone, anybody who feels he's been
harmed by Microsoft can walk into a court and get a jury trial. . .
. If you're a company like Microsoft, the last place you want to be
is in front of a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wood, of Boston law firm Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, said the
danger of private suits based on Friday's ruling is so severe that
it practically ensures Microsoft will fight to the bitter end,
rather than settle. ``To stop now and not finish could leave
Microsoft exposed to private litigation,'' said Wood, who chairs a
committee on antitrust law for the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wood predicted that Microsoft will soldier on, taking up the
next phase of the case in an effort to recoup its loss. In the next
phase, the findings of law, Jackson will apply antitrust law to the
facts he has settled upon. Microsoft will have to argue that even
if the facts are accepted as true, they don't constitute a
violation of law.
</P>
<P>
   Scott says the government's nearly total victory on findings of
fact bodes ill for Microsoft in the next phase of the trial, and
even reduces the likelihood of a successful appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has had some success before federal appellate courts.
An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court
for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals
court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet
browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key
issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott says the sweeping rejection of Microsoft's view of the
case will bear weight with the appeals court. ``They have an uphill
battle on appeal,'' he said. ``The facts have been decided against
them rather severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems unlikely Microsoft can now simply settle the
case, not only because of the threat of private lawsuits but
because the government is now in a position to make very tough
demands. Besides, 19 state attorneys general are involved in the
suit, as well as the federal government. Microsoft would have to
satisfy them all. ``It's difficult to settle a case when there's
blood in the water,'' said Scott, ``and this result does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ferguson, who sold Vermeer Technologies in Cambridge,
Mass. to Microsoft in 1997, is a harsh critic of the company. ``I
think they're going to fight to the death,'' Ferguson said. ``It's
their whole culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson's ruling could have an impact on other cases
already pending against Microsoft. The firm is still fighting
against rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in federal court. At issue is
whether Microsoft violated Sun's copyright to the Java computing
system, which allows programmers to write programs that can run on
many different types of computers. An appeals court in August
overturned an injunction against Microsoft, but Sun is seeking to
have that injunction reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   If this weren't enough for Microsoft, the company faces another
antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention
but could be equally devastating to Microsoft's future.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera Systems Inc., an Orem, Utah, maker of Linux software,
filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996. The case
involves DR-DOS, an operating system once sold by Novell Inc. as an
alternative to an early Microsoft product, MS-DOS. Caldera chief
executive Ray Noorda formerly ran Novell, and he bought DR-DOS from
Novell in order to pursue a court case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Noorda believes that during the early 1990s, Microsoft used its
market power to stamp out DR-DOS and keep it from gaining a
foothold in the operating systems market. If Caldera wins, it could
obtain damages running into the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal judge in Salt Lake City threw out an
effort by Microsoft to have key charges in the case dismissed. The
judge ruled that the Caldera-Microsoft case will go to trial in
January. Unlike the Justice Department case, the Caldera matter
will be decided by a jury chosen from Caldera's back yard _ a
daunting prospect for Microsoft.
