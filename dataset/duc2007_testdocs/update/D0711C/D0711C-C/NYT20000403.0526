   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's antitrust
laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an
oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal
judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided
with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive
antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling
for Microsoft in one area.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit
contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition
in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the
Netscape browser. Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in
November, overwhelmingly supported that view.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said that Monday's ruling, applying the
antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a
powerful remedy. That will be decided in a separate proceeding to
begin within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct
to breaking up the company. Senior government officials familiar
with the views of the state and federal officers who are pursuing
the case said that many were interested in requesting a breakup,
though no decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed.
On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four
months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of
a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained
unbridgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets
had closed. But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and
in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged Monday,
losing almost 14 percent of its value. That helped fuel a broad
decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 43-page conclusions of law, Jackson's final judgment on
the evidence, the judge wrote that ``the court concludes that
Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means
and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as
``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' _ all
in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing
arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at
Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that
point. Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to
the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that
Microsoft would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know
_ that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more
affordable to millions,'' Gates said. ``We believe we have a strong
case on appeal.''
