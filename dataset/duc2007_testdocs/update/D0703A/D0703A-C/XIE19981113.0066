<HEADLINE> Euro May Pose Strategical and Tactical Problems </HEADLINE>

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of the
single European currency, the Euro, would pose strategical as well
as tactical problems to the economy of Romania, an associate EU
country seeking admission, the Rompres news agency Thursday quoted
Romania's Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Romanian bankers and economists could not be indifferent to the
future of Euro in the international payment system and as a
reserve currency, the evolution of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate,
the relations which will be established between the national
currency Leu and Euro, or Euro's effect on Romanian commercial and
payments balance, Isarescu said at a Wednesday colloquium on Euro
by the Romanian Society of Economics.
</P>
<P>
The answers to these matters represent the precondition for
identifying the monetary and currency policies which might ensure,
in the shortest delay, the criteria for a convergence between the
Romanian economic and monetary system, on the one hand, and the
Economic and monetary Union, on the other hand, the Governor
added.
