European bank boss says euro won't compete with dollar
</HEADLINE>

	   BERLIN (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't
compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign
reserves.
	   The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank does not plans to
encourage the use of the euro as a reserve currency, Duisenberg
said, speaking at a conference in Berlin.
	   The euro will be adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15
countries on New Year's Day, but won't go into circulation on the
streets until 2002. It is the key element of Europe's imminent
economic and monetary merger.
	   Speculation has surrounded the euro's launch, with some
economists predicting countries may switch the foreign reserves
from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which represents some of the
strongest economies of the world.
	   Duisenberg emphasized that the priority of the new economic zone
is price stability, adding that the bank does not plan to encourage
the euro's use as an investment or transaction currency, or to use
it as an instrument of foreign policy.
	   However, the bank would monitor carefully fluctuations of
international exchange rates, especially that of the dollar, since
``possible major dollar movements could have negative effects on
the euro zone's domestic economic situation,'' Duisenberg said.
	   The dollar has been weakening against European currencies in
recent months. Currency fluctuations could affect the movement of
money to or away from investment portfolios in Europe, and that was
something to be watched, Duisenberg said.
	   Countries taking part in the monetary merger are Germany,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg,
Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Finland _ creating an economic zone of
some 300 million people.
