<HEADLINE> Most German Companies Not Ready for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for
the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due
to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps
to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the
country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they possibly wouldn't be able to do transactions
in Euro from the day it takes effect.
</P>
<P>
The European Union member states are required to completely
replace their own national currencies with the Euro from January
1, 2002.
