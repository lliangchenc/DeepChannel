<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will benefit from the
establishment of the European Union Common Currency and the
proposed dollar, the single currency of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a Zambian bank official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Mwenda, director of financial markets of Bank of
Zambia, said that if the EU comes up with one single
Euro-currency this will make it easy for Zambia to deal with one
currency and help reduce costs, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today also quoted senior economist with
the bank Jacob Lushinga as saying that the idea of a single
currency is to help facilitate trade and enhance exchange of
goods that could be beneficial to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Lushinga said the importance of the Euro-currency will depend
on Zambia's major trading partners.

<P>
The EU is Zambia's second main market for non-traditional
exports after COMESA.
