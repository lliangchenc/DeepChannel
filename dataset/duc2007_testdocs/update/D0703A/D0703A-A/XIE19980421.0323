BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Private investors are set to benefit
from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the
euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced
currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank
Bundesbank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly report issued Monday, the Bundesbank said
that as national currency boundaries vanish and most European
stocks and bonds are denominated in euros, investors will be able
to make use of a variety of cross-border investment opportunities
in the euro area which will become the second largest capital
market in the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, investors are also set to benefit from reduced
transaction costs and improved market transparency resulting from
heated competitions among financial institutions after the advent
of the euro, the Bundesbank said.
