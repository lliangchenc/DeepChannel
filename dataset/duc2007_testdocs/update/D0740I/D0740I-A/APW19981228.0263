Swiss hopeful over Chinese clearance for balloon attempt

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China
will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly
the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world
flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
	   The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone
its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals
Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect
previously agreed conditions.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and
is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard
and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
	   Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had
previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday. It would be
Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a
balloon around the world nonstop.
	   Beijing originally gave British tycoon Branson, Chicago
millionaire Fossett and Lindstrand, of Sweden, permission to cross
China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday. After
diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the
balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left
China as quickly as possible.
	   Caught in poor weather conditions, the team splashed down off
Hawaii Friday.
	   Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream
winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
	   Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by
strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs,
Australia.
