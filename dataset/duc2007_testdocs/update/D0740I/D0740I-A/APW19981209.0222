	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand
Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his
teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
	   Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown. A
statement from Piccard's organization said Jones had been training
as a backup pilot for more than a year.
	   Brown stood down by mutual agreement after differences between
the pilots emerged, ``particularly in the area of crew resource
management,'' it added.
	   The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau
d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions
are favorable. The team says it is technically ready to fly.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot
a balloon around the world nonstop. Four other teams, including a
combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
	   Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco. The
other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and
Albuquerque, N.M.
	   Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and
flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.
	   An offer by Brown to give technical expertise and advice during
the balloon's flight has been accepted, the Breitling team said.
