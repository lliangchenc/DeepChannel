<HEADLINE> Balloonists Cross Dominican Rep. </HEADLINE>

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Fatigued and chilled but  
exhilarated by their success, two adventurers soared over the 
Dominican Republic on the back of strengthening winds in a final 
push to become the first balloonists to circle the globe nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of  
Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, 
traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on 
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could only find a fast jet stream and whiz across the  
Atlantic, that would be great,'' Brian Smith, a flight controller, 
said from a control tower in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for a quick Atlantic crossing -- the team hopes to make  
it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey by Saturday or 
early Sunday -- picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found 
strong winds at 34,500 feet. It was traveling at 83 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a low day yesterday when they slowed down and things  
didn't look very good. Today it's very positive, they've got better 
winds than (had been) forecast,'' said Jones' wife, Joanna, working 
a 14-hour day at the control center. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the team was over the Domincan Republic and preparing  
for the Atlantic crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think their spirits will soar when they start a crossing  
because it's the last leg,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite thermal underwear, the pilots were shivering in the  
balloon's cabin, where the temperature was 46 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The team raced across the Pacific in six days and scooted over  
Mexico on Wednesday, with winds pushing them to speeds of 115 mph. 
But they slowed after being ejected from the jet stream and started 
to drift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tiring day, one of the most difficult,'' Smith  
said Wednesday. He added that the balloonists ``have been 
fantastic, fatigued but in very good spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns about communications and fuel consumption,  
Smith said the pilots were confident they would make it to North 
Africa and complete the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anheuser-Busch brewery company of St. Louis is offering  
$500,000 to the first balloonists to make it around the world, and 
an equal amount to the charity of the winners' choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first attempt at circumnavigating the world, the two  
have beat the record set last year by American millionaire Steve 
Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of 
Sweden. The three ditched their balloon off Hawaii in December 
after flying 13,751 miles, more than halfway around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, the chances of Jones and Piccard flying all the way  
to Egypt's pyramids, as Jones had hoped to do, appeared ``quite 
improbable,'' Smith said. The pilots now hope to land further west, 
in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last  
great tests facing balloonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 choice right now would be outside the best hotel in  
Casablanca, with a large'' parking lot, Smith said.
