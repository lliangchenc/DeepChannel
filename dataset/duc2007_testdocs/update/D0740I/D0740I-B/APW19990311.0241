	GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to  
fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, 
trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones  
of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward 
Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to fly over the ocean for six days instead of  
hugging the Asian coastline and hitting North America farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	``What frightens us most about crossing the Pacific is bad  
weather in an area where rescue will be long and possibly 
difficult,'' the control center quoted Jones as saying. ``I'm just 
hoping we won't bump into any bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard and Jones were flying at 55 mph at an altitude of 26,200  
feet. They have covered about than 12,000 miles since taking off 
March 1 from the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	The control center said the balloonists were so concerned about  
the Pacific they didn't take time to celebrate crossing China, one 
of the major hurdles of their trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese allowed them to pass through a narrow strip and  
reminded them three times during the 14-hour crossing that they 
were sometimes less than 25 miles from the no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he  
failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure 
from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson gave up over  
the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they 
lacked Chinese permission.
