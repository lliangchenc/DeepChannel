World Heritage Committee to investigate mining plans in sensitive park

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Debate about the impact of mining in a
remote region of Australia reopened Wednesday after UNESCO's World
Heritage Bureau decided to investigate claims the area is under
threat.
	   Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining
lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed
by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and
environmental sites.
	   The park is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. kms) of
largely untouched floodplains and plateau on Australia's north
coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200 kms) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species
including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is also recognized for the cultural values of the
Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000
years and their cave paintings, rock carvings and other
archaeological sites. Thousands of tourists visit the park every
year.
	   The bureau resolved in Paris overnight to send a high-level
mission to Australia after receiving submissions from Aboriginal
traditional owners of the area and others that Jabiluka will put
Kakadu's world heritage values at risk.
	   The Australian government has assured the bureau its
environmental safeguards will not let the region's world heritage
or natural or cultural values be affected by the mine, the bureau
resolution says.
	   ``Because of the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the
issue however ... the World Heritage Committee should visit
Australia and examine the situation further,'' the resolution says.
	   World Heritage Committee chairman Prof. Francesco Francioni will
lead the delegation, which will report to the committee's meeting
in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
	   While in Australia earlier this year, advisor to the committee
Jim Thorsell said Kakadu could be put on UNESCO's ``in danger''
list, indicating the organization believes the values of the site
are in jeopardy.
	   Such a listing is not binding on the Australian government and
would not necessarily prevent the mine from going ahead.
	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said the government will
cooperate with the investigation, but that it is unnecessary
because ``there is no evidence that the world heritage values are
at risk.''
	   Mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has
consistently said its environmental record has been proven by the
16-year operation of the Ranger uranium mine. Both mining leases
are within Kakadu's boundaries, but are technically not part of the
park.
	   Independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on
the environment from uranium mining at Ranger, ERA chief executive
Philip Shirvington said, welcoming the prospect of further
international scrutiny.
	   ``If they are genuine and open in their objectives then we have
nothing to fear,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
