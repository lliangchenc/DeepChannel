	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a  
congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep 
lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest twist in the Gingriches' bitter divorce fight,  
lawyers for Marianne Gingrich charged in court papers Monday that 
Gingrich ``willfully failed and refused to answer virtually each 
and every interrogatory concerning his personal and professional 
relationships as well as the finances of his marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in motions filed last week in Superior Court for the  
District of Columbia, Callista Bisek, a clerk for the House 
Agriculture Committee, asked a judge to overturn a Georgia court 
order requiring her to answer questions about her relationship with 
Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	No hearing has been set, but Ms. Bisek's scheduled appearance  
Wednesday for questioning by Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers likely will be 
postponed until her motions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers filed in Marietta, Ga., where the Gingriches lived,  
show that Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed 32 sets of questions to 
Gingrich, including one about sexual relationships with other 
women. He answered parts of only two sets of the questions that 
dealt with sources of his income and retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich  
gave Ms. Bisek money or spent the couple's money on her. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Evans, Gingrich's lawyer, said Georgia divorce law limits  
each side to 50 questions, and with the 32 questions and their 
subparts Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed more than 150. 
</P>
<P>
	``We answered 50 and told them if they want more than that, they  
need to follow the rules,'' said Evans. ``There has been no refusal 
to answer. It's just that we're going to go by the rules the best 
we can. Otherwise, this thing will spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But John Mayou, attorney for Mrs. Gingrich, said using the  
50-question rule is simply ``a ploy not to answer legitimate 
questions.'' In his court filing, he described the position taken 
by Gingrich's lawyers as ``preposterous and unsupported by any 
authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans characterized the accusations as ``litigation saber  
rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute will be decided by a Superior Court judge in  
Marietta, after a hearing that has yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving to block her testimony, Ms. Bisek argued that her  
constitutional right to privacy would be violated if Mrs. 
Gingrich's attorneys were allowed ``to rummage through every aspect 
of her personal life without any meaningful restrictions or 
limitations of any nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also argued that she cannot be required to testify about her  
relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition 
against self-incrimination, because adultery is a crime in the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena to Ms. Bisek requests documents and other items  
dating from January 1995, when Gingrich became speaker. They 
include cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms. 
Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone 
records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; 
photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video 
recordings of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requests any of Gingrich's clothes or other  
personal items in Ms. Bisek's possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, was separated from his wife of 18 years on May 10  
and filed for divorce July 29. The Gingriches reached an agreement 
this month on how to temporarily split their assets until the 
divorce is final.
