	ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) -- Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle  
his divorce by relying on a financial agreement he and his wife 
worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former 
House Speaker came back to an empty home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All she left was a television and a guest bed,'' Thomas  
Browning, Gingrich's divorce attorney, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 amid allegations he is having  
an affair with 33-year-old congressional aide Callista Bisek. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents related to the divorce filed Friday in Cobb County  
Superior Court include a separation agreement signed by the couple 
and notarized in December 1987. There is no indication it was ever 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning said Marianne Gingrich called her husband on his  
birthday in June 1987 to tell him she was leaving him. Gingrich, he 
said, came back to Georgia to find his home emptied out. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning said the pair maintained separate residences for six  
years before reconciling in late 1993 or early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The separation agreement called for Mrs. Gingrich to get $2,000  
a month for six months, control over money market and checking 
accounts and the couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird. It made Gingrich 
responsible for the couple's bank loans and a Hecht's department 
store account. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also divided the furniture in Washington residence  
and in their apartment in Jonesboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, who now runs a political consulting firm, filed his  
request after his wife asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets 
until their divorce is final. Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband 
transferred ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' 
before filing for divorce. Gingrich has denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from  
Ohio, referred all questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney 
John Mayoue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayoue was out of the office Monday and could not be reached for  
comment.
