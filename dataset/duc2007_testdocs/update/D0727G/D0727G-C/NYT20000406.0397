 &HT;    Gingrich divorce settled in secret

   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich is a bachelor again.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in
the former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret
settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Judge Dorothy Robinson made the Gingriches' divorce
final and agreed to seal the agreement, which they signed early
this week. By doing so, the Gingriches spared themselves any
embarrassment that could have come from trying their case in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' said Tom Browning, an attorney for Newt Gingrich,
who was not present at Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A sedate Marianne Gingrich, who did attend the hearing, had only
this to say about the often bitter eight-month-long divorce
process: ``It's been a difficult period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the courthouse after the hearing, Marianne
Ginther Gingrich, 48, added that she will keep her ex-husband's
last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know me by that name,'' she said. ``We've been
married a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair
with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce July 29. The
couple and their attorneys spent nearly the next five months
arguing over depositions and money, going to court twice.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 16, during a court-ordered mediation that ended
after 12 hours, the Gingriches reached a tentative agreement. The
couple's attorneys took another three months to work out the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's short and relatively quiet hearing was in stark
contrast to the posturing by both sides early on.
</P>
<P>
   In his July divorce petition, Newt Gingrich said the marriage
was ``irretrievably broken,'' a standard clause under Georgia's
``no fault'' divorce laws. In her answer, Marianne Gingrich denied
the claim, offering no explanation for why.
</P>
<P>
   And she still won't say. On Thursday, Marianne Gingrich told the
judge that the marriage was indeed ``irretrievably broken.'' Here's
what else the public likely will never know:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Newt Gingrich tried to transfer ``certain valuable
assets'' before filing for divorce, as Marianne Gingrich alleged.
</P>
<P>
   _ The details of Newt Gingrich's affair with Callista Bisek, a
33-year-old scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, and how
he carried it on without Marianne Gingrich's knowledge. Bisek was
ordered to sit for a deposition with Marianne Gingrich's lawyers,
but the case was settled before that happened.
</P>
<P>
   _ What the couple's associates would have to say about the
marriage and Gingrich's affair. Newt Gingrich won permission to
depose Marianne Gingrich's sister and a friend, both in Ohio.
Marianne Gingrich won permission to depose members of her husband's
political and business associates, including his self-described
closest adviser, Joe Gaylord. None of those depositions occurred.
</P>
<P>
   _ And what Newt Gingrich earns. That information is sealed away
in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Since resigning as speaker and from the congressional seat he
held for 20 years, Gingrich has been making a living giving
speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as
a political analyst on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich plans to continue her work with the Red Cross
and various charity groups. She indicated Thursday that she is
evaluating several business opportunities as well, but would not
elaborate.
