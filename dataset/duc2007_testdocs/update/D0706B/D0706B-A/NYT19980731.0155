<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the
people concerned and discuss the problem with them. That is what
democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people
because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
</P>
<P>
   As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course
against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they
are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma. Reports
describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's
partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack
problems at their source. They seem to think that if they insist
the problem does not exist, it will simply go away. The best way to
deal with AIDS is through education. So we need a really widespread
AIDS education program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _
political, economic and medical. AIDS education would be just one
part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in
our country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because
that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want. We all
want justice and human rights. Since what we want will benefit all
the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much personal danger do you feel? Have you been
threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the
people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course
the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our
forces. (She laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   But we don't think about that too much. There's no time to be
thinking about such things.
