<P>
   In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country
Myanmar, Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent
on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power,
build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against
stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, evidence is increasing that the Burmese army is using
another tool of war against minority populations: rape.
</P>
<P>
   The use of rape as a weapon in ethnic conflict is not uncommon;
it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently,
Indonesia. But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have
received little attention, in part because the rapes have been
perpetrated in inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops
``continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and
there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by
soldiers.'' According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on
Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting ``increasing
numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly'' and
subjecting them to rape and other abuses. The Burmese Women's Union
alleges that ``women have been raped in an organized and systematic
way'' by the army.
</P>
<P>
   A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Burmese citizens in a US
federal court in 1996 targeted the Burmese military junta and two
oil companies -- Unocal Corp., then based in Los Angeles, and Total
of France -- for abuses allegedly committed during construction of
a natural gas pipeline in Burma, charging that ``girls and women
have been raped in the presence of family members.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be
held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will
hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent
because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be
raped are refugees, internally displaced women, and women belonging
to ethnic minorities or the political opposition. Rapes by the
military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are
abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced
relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of
a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human
rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials. Bolstering those
contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal
rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's
military of ``the savage domination of women outside the scope of
acceptable wartime conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says that ``the violent sexual abuse of ethnic
Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence
against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.
</P>
<P>
   Thaung Tun, deputy chief of mission at the Burmese embassy in
Washington, denies there is anything to investigate. ``It is hardly
possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis. Maybe on
an individual basis. But if it happens, there are laws in place,
and people would be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the
army.
</P>
<P>
   According to EarthRights, they are given little food, forbidden
contact with their families, and forced to beat each other for
punishment. Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young
recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have
been indoctrinated to believe are ``the people's enemy'' and
``internal destructionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the
violence against women is directly related to the military's goal
of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide
against a particular minority.
</P>
<P>
   One widely circulated document -- whose origin remains
unverified -- appears to lend credence to the claims that rape is a
conscious tool of war in Burma. Marked ``top secret'' and dated
only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988, the document
is addressed to ``All Great Ruling Burmans'' and outlines a policy
of ``blood mixing'' and ``Burmanization'' of ethnic minorities -- a
reference to the process by which Burmans, who now represent
two-thirds of Burma's population, could become more dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The document says ``the easiest way to implement these ideas is
to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,'' for
which it offers a financial reward. ``We must deviously attack
those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,'' the
document states.
</P>
<P>
   In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the
father only.
</P>
<P>
   Burmese opposition leader Sein Win -- an elected member of the
Burmese parliament who now heads the country's government in exile
-- believes the document originated in the defense ministry's
department of psychological warfare. ``Regardless of the source or
intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic
cleansing policy of the Burmese military,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are
fueled by the policies expressed in this document.''
</P>
<P>
   U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he
was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text
of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications
between two Burmese military commanders. Ka Hsaw Wa, a veteran
Karen human rights investigator who organizes fact-finding missions
for Human Rights Watch, says he encountered the ``Burmanization''
document in the Shan, Karen, and Karenni areas, where his sources
retrieved it from Burman soldiers and outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is impossible to gather precise statistics about the
incidence of rape as a tool of the Burmese military --
geographical, military, and cultural barriers make that impossible,
say human rights workers -- anecdotal evidence continues to mount.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old
mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of
giving rice to the insurgents. After the assault, they poured
boiling water over her. She died three days later.
</P>
<P>
   In another village, a woman named Naing Mai was raped over five
days by military personnel. She was then burned to death, according
to the account that local farmers, who watched from hiding places,
later gave Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report last month from the Shan Human Rights
Foundation, Aye Nang, another young mother of three, was raped by
troops on March 5 in the village of Wan Pek. She was then stabbed
four times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave, uncovered by
villagers three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Green, staff lawyer with the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights, is convinced that the Burmese military is
guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by the UN war-crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has
declared rape a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that
these acts of violence against women are both widespread and
systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are
targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a
certain ethnic group,'' says Green, who is a cocounsel in the
lawsuit against Unocal and Total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing acceptance that rape is not just a form of
humiliating treatment but is an extreme form of violence and should
be regarded as torture.''
