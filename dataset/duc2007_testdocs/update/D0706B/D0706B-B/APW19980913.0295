Vice chairman of Myanmar opposition party threatened with arrest

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The vice chairman of Myanmar opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party was threatened with
arrest in a commentary in a government-run newspaper Sunday.
	   The commentary in Sunday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper said
that Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy,
had violated the terms of his 1995 parole from prison and would
have to serve out the remainder of his sentence if he continued to
violate Myanmar laws.
	   The NLD said earlier this week that the military has arrested
702 of its members since May, including 194 elected members of
parliament.
	   More than half the arrests took place this week as the
government sought to prevent the NLD from convening parliament. The
NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.
	   Also on Sunday, a student exiles group claimed that 15 military
officers, including army colonels, had been arrested by the ruling
junta for planning to meet and talk with Suu Kyi.
	   The report from the All Burma Students Democratic Front could
not be independently confirmed and the military government
spokesman was not available for comment.
	   NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, 71, who has been imprisoned twice by
Myanmar's military leaders, is a former defense minister, army
commander in chief, Buddhist monk and lawyer.
	   He was placed under house arrest the same day as Suu Kyi in 1989
and later sentenced to three years in Insein Prison for violating
the 1950 Emergency Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows the
military to jail people for as little as allegedly thinking
anti-government thoughts.
	   In 1992, the military extended Tin Oo's sentence by another
seven years. He was released on March 15, 1995 after he appealed to
Gen. Than Shwe, the junta leader, according to the commentary in
the New Light of Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   ``While serving the prison terms, Tin Oo submitted an appeal to
Senior General Than Shwe asking for pardon and promising he will
not take part in any political activities or in any activity that
would hamper the government's development works,'' the commentary
said.
	   ``On humanitarian grounds and due to Tin Oo's previous service
in the army, the remaining prison sentence was suspended. He signed
an undertaking saying he would not violate the law,'' it said.
	   ``Tin Oo may have to serve the remaining prison sentence if he
does not live up to his promises.''
	   The commentary also accused Tin Oo of trying to sow discord in
the army.
	   In 1974, Tin Oo ran afoul of former dictator Ne Win when he
refused to order his troops to open fire on unarmed student
demonstrators.
	   Ne Win accused him of plotting a coup and had him imprisoned in
1976. He was amnestied in 1980.
	   He retains a reputation as having been a heroic commander who
was well-liked by his troops, but he inspires a deep animosity from
officers in the military government for opposing military rule.
	   Tin Oo fought alongside Suu Kyi's father, independence hero Aung
San, during the campaign to end British colonial rule in the 1940s
and was among the first group of officers commissioned in the Burma
army.
