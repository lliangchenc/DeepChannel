   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen.
John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the
president expanded veto power to harness ``pork-barrel'' spending
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court declared unconstitutional a
McCain-sponsored law giving the president authority to wipe out
wasteful programs contained in larger spending bills. Before the
law's enactment in 1996, the president could veto an entire
spending measure but not individual items.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that such a specialized veto can be authorized
only through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, R-Ariz., and other line-item veto backers, vowed to
push instead for a slightly different measure in Congress that,
this time, would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators feared the court's ruling would usher in a new
era of the sort of bloated, special-interest spending that Congress
was long known for _ such projects as microbreweries, boat marinas
and other ``pork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This defeat means that we will return and retreat to the
practice of loading up otherwise necessary legislation with
pork-barrel spending,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``The Supreme
court has resurrected a pig, or pork, that we thought was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was a defeat for McCain, who forced a vote
on a line-item veto nearly every year for a decade until its
approval two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to point out that it's been a wonderful two weeks for
me,'' a droll McCain told reporters after the decision. ``I haven't
had quite this much fun since I was last interrogated in Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, lost his bid to
pass a sweeping anti-tobacco bill last week and was criticized for
telling a crude joke at a fund-raiser about the president's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the line-item veto by the Senate after so many
failures had been considered one of the crowning achievements of
McCain's career. House Republicans made the line-item veto a part
of their Contract with America, the agenda they credited for
electing a GOP majority to Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the law violates that part of the
Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president
for his approval or veto. The court said the Constitution does not
allow for what, in effect, are partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the
``profound importance'' of the issue and said that ``the procedures
authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will
play a different role in determining the text of what may become a
law, such change must come not by legislation but through the
amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is a former Arizona state
lawmaker, dissented, along with Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato
growers' group after President Clinton vetoed provisions they
sought. &QL;
