EDITORIAL: THE COURT VETOES LINE ITEM

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26:
</P>
<P>
   In a sound and much-needed decision, the Supreme Court has
rejected the line-item veto as a departure from the basic
constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills
in their entirety. The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul
Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling
specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising
authority delegated to him by Congress. Instead the court found
that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of
Article I. That clause establishes the process by which a bill
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the
procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional
defect. The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of
powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress. That issue,
however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's
concurring opinion. ``By increasing the power of the president
beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute
compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which
the separation of powers seeks to secure.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court
veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First
Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the
National Endowment for the Arts. The law in question ordered the
NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making
grants. Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an
advisory opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that
unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory
mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of
causing offense in any quarter.'' Some of the justices who joined
the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect
the NEA from further congressional attacks. But in all likelihood
this ruling will simply embolden enemies of government funding for
the arts. &QL;
