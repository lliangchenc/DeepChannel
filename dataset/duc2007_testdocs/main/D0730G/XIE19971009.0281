<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs 1998 U.S. Military Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed a 247.7 billion U.S. dollar military spending bill
for the 1998 fiscal year starting October 1.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is
excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item
veto power.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding
than was approved for the previous year. It cuts off funding for
U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president
certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says
the bill in a cautious language.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment
for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to
Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
</P>
<P>
The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than
the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed
"concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto
authority to shrink the bill.
</P>
<P>
"The bill provides 4.2 billion dollars more than I requested in
my 1998 budget, and 1.2 billion dollars more than the levels that
my administration believes were agreed to in the bipartisan budget
agreement" between Congress and the White House, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the
measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as
to how much Clinton would target in a veto.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton used the law to veto 38 spending items in a
military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
The "could-be" vetoed spending items include half a billion
dollars in congressionally added spending on eight C-130J military
transport aircraft not in either the Pentagon's budget request or
in the request Clinton sent to Capitol Hill. The planes are built
in Marietta, Georgia, hometown of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Congress also added 100 million dollars for an LPD-17
amphibious assault ship, to be built near the hometown of
Representative Bob Livingston, Republican from Louisiana and
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and 720 million
dollars for an Aegis destroyer built in the hometown of Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from Mississippi.
