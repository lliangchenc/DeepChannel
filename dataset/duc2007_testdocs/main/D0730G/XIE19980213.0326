<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department to Appeal Line-Item Veto Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department is
planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge
struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling,
but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be
upheld by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president
has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its
appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to
small numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on
a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then
vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the
House of Representatives and Senate to override.
</P>
<P>
In his Thursday ruling, U.S. Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the
law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers
among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to
the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the
state of extra federal funds for Medicaid -- the federal health
insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.
The White House later worked out an agreement giving New York much
of the money.
</P>
<P>
The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers,
who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the
line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in
its first full year.
</P>
<P>
In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The
line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to
strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
