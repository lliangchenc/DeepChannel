<HEADLINE> Clinton to Appeal Line-Item Veto Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck
down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items
in bills passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he was "disappointed." "I intend to appeal
it," Clinton said of the ruling. "We ought to give the Supreme
Court a chance to have their say on it."
</P>
<P>
"I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to
preserve the integrity of federal spending and I hope very much we
can sustain it and we have to appeal it," Clinton told reporters
as he was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the
nation.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision
late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and
still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal
spending and the balance of power in government.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president
for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and
certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress. Previously, the
president could only veto entire bills.
