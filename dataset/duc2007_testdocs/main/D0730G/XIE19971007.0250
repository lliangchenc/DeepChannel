<HEADLINE> US President Vetoes 38 Items in Military Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today used his line-item veto power to strike out 38 projects
worth 287 million U.S. dollars from a military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
"Government must continue to live within its means," Clinton
said in cutting the military outlays from the 9.2 billion U.S.
dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
The vetoed projects include a 19.9 million dollar plan to
build a new wharf for ship repair at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in
Virginia; a 17.9 million dollar pier improvement project at
Florida's Mayport Naval Station; a 16 million dollar railroad
project at Fort Carson, Colo.; four projects in California and
three in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an
angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction
projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of
specific congressmen and senators.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state was spared,
although six Mississippi projects were added to the military
construction bill. Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, home state of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will lose a 6.8 million dollar
combat search and training center if the president's veto is
upheld.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto, sought by U.S. presidents for more than a
century, gives the president the ability to cancel special
interest tax breaks as well as specific spending items that he
deems wasteful while avoiding killing the entire measure.
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time Clinton had exercised the line-item
veto authority, which went into effect in January.
