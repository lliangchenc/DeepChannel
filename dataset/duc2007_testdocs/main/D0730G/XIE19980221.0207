<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Appeals to Save Line-Item Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
Friday appealed the Supreme Court a federal judge's decision
striking down the presidential line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear
argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before
the end of the term in late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law, which took effect in January 1997,
allows the president to veto selected budget items five days after
signing a bill.
</P>
<P>
Congress may override a line-item veto by a simple majority
vote. But if the president vetoes the simple majority override, a
two-thirds majority is needed to override after that.
</P>
<P>
The law was challenged last year by a group of mostly
Democratic senators, but the Supreme Court dismissed the
challenge, saying President Bill Clinton had not yet used the
selective veto and therefore the group had no standing to bring
suit.
</P>
<P>
But another group of challengers, led by New York State, filed
suit, contending that the line-item veto is unconstitutional. New
York had standing because one of Clinton's line-item vetoes struck
out extra Medicare funding for the state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan struck
down the line-item veto law, saying it "impermissibly upsets the
balance of powers so carefully prescribed by (the Constitution's)
framers."
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, the Justice Department argues that the new
challengers also do not have standing to challenge the law, and
that in any case the law is in line with the historic relationship
between Congress and the president.
