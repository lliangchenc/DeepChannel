   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress
violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the
president the power to cut individual projects from tax and
spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act
unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after
its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house

law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of

procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of
separation of powers among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be
desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is
constitutional.

   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying
