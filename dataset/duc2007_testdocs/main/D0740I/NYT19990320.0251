   Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of
aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the
Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of
the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:54 a.m. EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line
of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau
D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title
of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   The pair hoped to land at about dawn Sunday in Egypt, unless
their dwindling fuel supply forces them to come down earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged
that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the
pilots' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really grateful for the invisible hand that guided us
through all obstacles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, is the latest in a
family of explorers and record-setters. It was Auguste Piccard, his
grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the
stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and
the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier
of aviation to regular passenger travel.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his father, Jacques, who in 1960 set a record that
still stands Sunday for the deepest ocean dive, taking the
bathyscaphe Trieste nearly 7 miles deep in the Pacific Ocean's
Mariana Trench.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his illustrious forebears, Piccard grew up among
astronauts as his father worked for the US National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my childhood, I have seen a lot of adventurers, and
this gave me the wish to explore something on this beautiful
earth,'' Piccard said two years ago, just before making the first
of his three attempts at the record.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of dollars spent by each team for equipment
and the support crews needed for such voyages, success hinged on a
combination of luck, politics and fortitude. At least two previous
attempts that might have had a chance at succeeding were stymied by
failure to get overflight permission from China and Libya, forcing
them to divert into less favorable wind patterns. This flight, too,
was forced to detour to honor China's requirement to stay south of
26 degrees latitude, but was still able to stay in the high-speed
jetstream needed to propel it to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for
the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon
designs. While one record after another was set for distance
traveled and for time aloft, all these earlier efforts ended up
being thwarted by bad weather, technical malfunctions, or political
obstacles. But in the process, the design of high-tech versions of
the venerable Rozier balloon has progressed enormously, bringing
aviation's oldest design straight into the space age.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite navigation systems monitor the balloons' positions,
satellite communications keep them in touch with their control
centers, and satellite weather monitoring provides the guidance
essential to success _ and survival. Even the most high-tech
balloon is still at the mercy of the winds, its only means of
control being to rise or fall in order to catch the winds that seem
to be going in the most promising direction.
</P>
<P>
   It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the
feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon
itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types
of balloons: helium and hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Helium's advantage is that it requires no fuel to maintain its
lifting power; its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's
heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented,
depleting its supply. Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it
is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air;
when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down. But a Rozier
combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight,
and supplementing it at night with hot air.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no obvious practical benefit from this
spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design
engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific
research. Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons
extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and
astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to
circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas
because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious
to the rival team Saturday, calling it a ``magnificent
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurers themselves, the achievement still hadn't
quite sunk in. ``We are having great difficulty realizing our
dreams have come true,'' Piccard said. ``We are with the angels.''
