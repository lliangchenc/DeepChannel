	LONDON (AP) -- A pair of British balloonists trying to  
circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they 
crossed the path of a Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet over the  
South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner 
radioed a request to approach the balloon, the team's London 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their  
observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of 
windows and snapping pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing sight for us, particularly seeing so many  
friendly faces smiling at us after only having each other to stare 
at during the past 16 days,'' Elson was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the pilots nor ground control could identify the  
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, the two were over the Taiwan Straits southeast of the  
China coast, heading for northern Japan and a jet stream they hope 
will catapult them across the Pacific to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them,  
the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North 
America and in about two weeks' time to become the first 
balloonists to fly nonstop around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Their Cable and Wireless balloon, which launched from Spain on  
Feb. 17, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescot and Elson have been painstakingly negotiating the winds  
of North Africa, the Indian subcontinent and south Asia to avoid 
being drawn into China, which has denied them permission to fly 
through its air space. 
</P>
<P>
	An Anglo-Swiss team of balloonists, meanwhile, picked up  
altitude and speed over Africa's Sahara Desert after chipping off 
icicles that weighed down the craft and wasted fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Brian Jones climbed  
out of the hi-tech gondola of the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to 
break off some of the icicles with an ice pick on Thursday.
