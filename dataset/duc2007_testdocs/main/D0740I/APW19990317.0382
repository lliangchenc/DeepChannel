	House Committee Approves Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's 
breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers 
crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts. By a 22-18 
party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending 
plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing 
defense, education and several other programs. Simultaneously, the 
Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan. That 
panel planned to complete its work tomorrow.

	Weapons Labs Get New Security  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new  
security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and 
ordered an internal investigation into whether a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese 
espionage. Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door 
hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee was 
questioning Richardson on how the Clinton administration responded 
when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft 
of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in the 1980s.

	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired Army general who pleaded  
guilty to conduct unbecoming for having affairs with four 
subordinates' wives was reprimanded Wednesday and fined $10,000. In 
exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped nine other charges 
against Maj. Gen. David Hale, 53. If he had been convicted on the 
original charges, Hale could have faced 56 years in prison.

	Balloon Team Nears Jamaica

	GENEVA (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team was about 300 miles  
from Jamaica late Wednesday night and hoped to catch the next jet 
stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said. The 
pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, 
hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by 
Saturday evening. If they make it, the pair will have conquered one 
of the last great challenges facing aviators. Jones and Piccard 
have traveled more than 20,500 miles since lifting off from the 
Swiss Alps on March 1.

	Tire Marks Key to Train Probe  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are analyzing tire tracks  
in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a 
deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and 
beat the train. The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's 
City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's 
deadliest train wreck in three years. Tire marks were found on the 
road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder 
of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.

	Anesthesia Deaths Raise Concern  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spate of deaths -- most from cosmetic  
surgeries, but also among children undergoing dental work or MRI 
scans -- has experts questioning the safety of sedation in private 
doctors' offices. More surgery is moving to such offices, sometimes 
performed by physicians with little experience in handling powerful 
sedating drugs and little equipment to save patients who get into 
trouble, says Dr. John Neeld, president of the American Society of 
Anesthesiology. Nobody counts how many deaths or injuries result 
from office-administered anesthesia.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Weather Service's annual spring flood  
forecast Wednesday pointed to North Dakota and the Pacific 
Northwest as potential danger spots. The area of greatest flooding 
potential is along the Red River in North Dakota and Devil's Lake, 
N.D. Each year, floods kill 100-140 Americans and cause an average 
of $4.5 billion in damage.

	Heat Beat Hawks 86-85  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tim Hardaway scored 24 points and Miami survived  
a 3-point barrage by the Atlanta Hawks, holding on for an 86-85 
victory Wednesday night that stretched the Heat's winning streak to 
six. Mookie Blaylock had a chance to win it for Atlanta but missed 
a desperation jumper from the corner as time expired to end the 
Hawks' four-game winning streak, their longest of the season. Miami 
led nearly the entire game and held an 82-72 advantage after P.J. 
Brown hit a 12-foot jumper with 4:11 remaining.
