GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss and a Belgium were
forced to abandon their attempt to tour around the world without
stop by balloon six hours after they took off from the Swiss
Alpine resort of Chateau d'Oex this morning.
</P>

The two men, Bertrand Piccard and Wim Verstraeten, were rescued
by French helicopters in the Mediterranean where their balloon
landed because fuel from the heating system had leaked into the
cabin, according to a report by Swiss Radio International. They
are reportedly safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
The pressured cabin in which the two were staying is of five
tons with a dimension of five meters long and two meters wide.
