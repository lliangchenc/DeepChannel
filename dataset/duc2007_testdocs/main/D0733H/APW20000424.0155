<HEADLINE> Library of Congress' B'Day Marked  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 30 celebrities -- including TV's Big
Bird and Gen. Colin Powell -- were feted Monday as ''Living
Legends'' as they helped celebrate the 200th birthday of the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Jaroslav Pelikan from Yale University was chosen to
speak on behalf of the group. They received medals, along with
another 54 celebrities who were not present.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first thought,'' Pelikan told the group to explain why he
was picked as spokesman, ''is that I seem to be the only one among
those present whose last name puts him into the same class with Big
Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning serious, he compared the library with the ancient
one in Alexandria, Egypt, which had carved over its entrance the
words ''Hospital of the Soul.'' Pelikan, a historian of religion,
was introduced by Librarian James H. Billington as the author of 30
books and translator of the works of Martin Luther.
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston Celtics basketball star Larry Bird, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, 91-year-old practicing heart surgeon Dr.
Michael DeBakey and comedian Bob Hope also were honored.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bird -- Carroll Spinney -- joined the others on a stage set up
on the Capitol grounds across the street from the library. He wore
his regular eight-foot fuzzy yellow costume, adorned for the
occasion with a red and blue striped necktie.
</P>
<P>
   As the first speaker from the group on stage, he said he was
glad to be in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''D and C are two of my favorite letters,'' he added
instructively. ''Gee, I've never been to a birthday party for a
library before.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward as well as back, the Library also opened a new
Web site for children and a reconstruction of President Thomas
Jefferson's own book collection. Acquired after British forces
burned the original library in 1814, Jefferson's 6,487 books became
the core of what is now the world's biggest one.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the Library of Congress had 9,429,184 books and
nearly 110 million other items, in 460 languages.
</P>
<P>
   The Post Office marked the occasion by issuing a new 33-cent
stamp which shows the bright inside of the dome over the library's
main reading room. The U.S. Mint issued the first commemorative
coins of the century: a silver dollar that will sell for $28 to
$32, and its first gold-and-platinum $10 piece that will cost $395
to $425, complete with a satin-lined presentation case.
