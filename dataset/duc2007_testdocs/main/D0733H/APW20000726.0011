<HEADLINE> Panel Advises Library of Congress  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON -- The world's biggest library could turn into just a
''museum of books'' unless it gets started this year on long-range
plans to collect and secure the rising flood of digital
information, a federal advisory panel warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any questions about the right of the Library of
Congress to collect material from American Web sites, the National
Research Council said in a thick report, it should try to get the
law changed to make clear that it has the right.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Library) serves no narrow set of interests but the
broadest public purposes of a powerful nation,'' the report said.
''It represents the commitment of the governing bodies of that
nation to a strategy of preserving the heritage of the past and
making it useful for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council advises the federal government,
the public and the country's scientists and engineers. A committee
prepared the report under the leadership of James J. O'Donnell,
chief information officer and vice provost of the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The library is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. It
has more than 9 million books, 11 million films and photos and more
than 53 million manuscripts. Each year it puts about 1 million
largely historical items -- such as the papers of Presidents
Washington and Lincoln -- on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee's purpose ... is to encourage readers of this
report to take a deep breath and to look out to the horizon,'' it
said. ''With the Library and its friends focused on a common
vision, it will be easier to take the steps -- some small, some
large -- that need to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of this will be cheap. The Library has grown enormously
beyond what Congress could have expected in 1800. ... For what (the
Library) is and has been, the future will seem expensive, but for
the value it delivers to the nation and the world, the Library is
and always has been a bargain.''
