NATION'S LIBRARY WANTS TO SHELVE BOOKS BY SIZE, NOT SUBJECT

   WASHINGTON _ The biggest debate on Capitol Hill _ the one that
tells us most about our national character, the one that offers the
insight into the national mind _ is not about the future of
Medicare, or how to use the budget surplus, or whether taxes should
be cut, or whether defense spending ought to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest debate on Capitol Hill is over whether books ought
to be shelved by size.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the
national library _ or, more precisely, in Congress's library _ and
it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the
House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in
a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Shelving books by size, rather than content, is the idea of some
administrators of the library, which is awash in books. Too many
books. If all the large books were together on big shelves, all the
small books would be together on small shelves, there would be no
gaping holes _ lost space _ in between. Such a plan could, say its
supporters, increase shelf availability by as much as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but at what cost? At stake is the place of the written word
in the American imagination; the nation's devotion to the fine and
practiced art of browsing, even in the amazon.com age; the
scholar's impulse to break learning into subject areas; the
researcher's conviction that a truth, if not necessarily the truth,
can be stumbled upon if only a liberated mind is let loose amongst
the stacks of a great library.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily
tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items,
including more than 17,772,400 books.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of shelving books by size _ the notion of putting
the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones
somewhere else _ is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and
scholars. It is a dagger at the heart of the bibliophile's pastime,
browsing. And it is a threat to the greatest delight of the
researcher, serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than that. It screams order in a world where
learning only serves to underline the persistence of disorder. It
imposes neatness on the messy turmoil of the mind. It celebrates
efficiency in a realm of human endeavor where the great harvests
often come amid chaotic inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   So far scores of Library of Congress librarians, the Library of
Congress Professional Association, and Local 2910 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have howled in
protest. In truth, even the people floating the idea aren't wild
about it. But it hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have the library's space problems. Indeed, they've only
become greater.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few steps into Deck 9 of the John Adams Building, one of
the three massive structures the library maintains on Capitol Hill,
and you'll see why. Pause at the QA 76 section, where books on
computers are collected. So many books sit on the floor that a pair
of size 11 loafers cannot navigate the tiny space remaining between
the stacks. A small leak from the sprinklers would convey some of
the world's most sophisticated mathematical thought to damp
oblivion; the books sit directly beneath the water spouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the floor, the back cover at a 45-degree angle and
the spine under enormous strain, is a copy of the fourth edition of
Stephen Wolfram's ``The Mathematica.'' This is a book in the throes
of destruction in the world's greatest book collection, dedicated
above all to preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Down on Deck 7 of the stacks the situation is little better.
There, amid the neatly stacked collections of the library's justly
celebrated Asia collection, is the space problem displayed in stark
and unforgiving light. On the shelves are thousands of books,
assembled crisply by subject. But around the shelves themselves, in
a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national
library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled
every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier
field of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is
not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor
a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal
appropriation (some $400 million) is too small. It is simply a
measure of the explosion of information, publications, monographs,
newspapers, pamphlets, maps, moving images, photographs, posters,
prints, and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the problem is books. The book collection of the
world's biggest library _ half the collection is in languages other
than English, 460 in all _ is growing by about 300,000 volumes a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of space,'' complains Steven Herman, the
chief of the collection-management division of the library. ``We
have to see if we can make the most efficient use of the shelves we
have now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there
simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library
attracts about 2 million people a year _ making it one of the
biggest attractions for tourists in the capital _ the notion of
moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both
produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current
locations is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation _ quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might
put it _ the library already is taking some significant steps to
expand its shelf space. In 14 months the library will open a huge
off-site storage space in Fort Meade, Md., which should relieve
some of the pressure _ but at a price. The Fort Meade space will
not be open to browsing, and any book that a researcher requests
won't be available on Capitol Hill for half a day, maybe longer.
The library is planning two delivery runs a day from its new
state-of-the-art building (modern security, sophisticated
temperature and humidity controls) but researchers in Washington
for only a day are almost certainly going to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   A special library task force has come up with a number of
options to ease the strain. One is double-shelving, or placing a
smaller row of books in front of a larger row. The library already
employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging
through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find
the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the
House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the
volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
</P>
<P>
   But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by
size. Each book would have a fixed place on a fixed shelf. No need
to keep some empty space at the end of the shelf in the
anticipation that new works might be on the way. No need to worry
just where that new volume should rest, between which other
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   They'd go in, all in a row, catalogued precisely by computer, so
that the researcher looking for a copy of James Morris's ``Pax
Britannica'' or Carl Yastrzemski and Al Hirshberg's ``Yaz'' would
know exactly where to look. Moreover, William L. Shirer's ``The
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' Dr. Suess's ``The Cat in the
Hat,'' and John P. Marquand's ``The Late George Apley'' might be
sitting there right beside each other, being roughly the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Herman knows the plan has some disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get questions no one else can answer,'' he says. ``One of
the ways to answer them to to go to a section of the stacks and fan
through tables of contents or indexes and look. It's a lot easier
to look up something on lighthouses, for example, if you can just
go to one place and browse. It's easier to go to a shelf and see
exactly what's in the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very good arguments for continuing that,'' he
says. ``But it takes up significant amounts of space.''
</P>
<P>
   But the argument about shelving books by size is worth having,
not only because the great surge in printed material is causing a
problem that many libraries _ from Harvard and Cornell to the
national libraries of France and Britain _ can no longer avoid. It
is worth having, too, because it raises important questions about
the human mind and the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   And so now on Capitol Hill, so often the site for discussions
trite and trivial, the topic finally has turned to a clash of real
values, to a subject that has enduring significance, to a topic
that, more than most others, defines who we are, and how we
conserve the things that we value the most.
</P>
<P>
   This debate is occasioned, like most of the important debates of
the last quarter-century, by a deficit of some sort. But this one,
unlike the budget deficit (which has been slain) and the trade
deficit (which persists amid our prosperity), doesn't exist
primarily in accounting ledgers. It exists in real, physical space.
