   NEW YORK _ Betty Fussell, a food writer best known for a book on
the history of corn, says she often buys books rather than trying
to use those in the New York Public Library. ``Everything is
inaccessible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, to her and other food researchers, means the books
kept in the library's annex at 521 W. 43rd St., off 10th Avenue.
The annex was closed to the public in the spring of 1994. The
library decided that it was more efficient for the public to use
annex materials at the main building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd
Street, where security is better.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, researchers have had to request volumes at the main
library and then wait days for them to be delivered. Some
researchers warn that an irreplaceable trove of culinary knowledge
is in disarray, as books are no longer delivered between floors but
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, who has written a history of ketchup and is
awaiting publication of ``Popped Culture: A Social History of
Popcorn'' by the University of South Carolina Press, said he flies
to Washington to use the Library of Congress in preference to
trying to get the research materials he needs from the New York
library's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take three days to get a book from the annex _ if
you're lucky,'' he said. ``Half the time, the books are missing or
misplaced, and the condition they're in is often a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests over the inaccessibility and condition of the books
have spurred the library, which acknowleges the problems, to make
changes. With some 100,000 food-related books, 20,000 of them
cookbooks, the library boasts the second-largest culinary
collection in the country after the Library of Congress. Although
some of the older books are in the rare book room at the main
library, most are stored in the annex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I routinely get calls from researchers who are frustrated and
intimidated trying to use the New York Public Library's
collection,'' said Barbara Haber, the curator of books of the
Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., which
is known for its culinary collection. ``Food history is becoming
more serious. Many scholars are doing dissertations that are food
related. From where I sit it's a great collection, so why not take
care of it?''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Alexandra Leaf, the president of the Culinary
Historians of New York, wrote to the organization's 255 members
warning that ``a large number of books in the New York Public
Library's culinary collection have badly deteriorated: bindings are
worn, pages are crumbling or missing, and covers are chipped and
cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Coe, the chairman of the group's cookbook committee,
followed up with a letter to Dr. Paul LeClerc, the library's
president, stressing the importance of the collection and
suggesting remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Bowen, the library's director of humanities, then informed
Coe that the collection would be cleaned and put in protective
boxes, and transferred to a storage center with zones of
temperature and humidity controls. The center, which the library is
building in Princeton, N.J., is expected to be completed in about
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Once the books are transferred there, they will be delivered on
request to Manhattan the next day. Though Coe wrote in his letter
that he was alarmed by ``the specter of fragile materials being
shipped back and forth on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' he offered his
group's help, including fund-raising, to preserve the culinary
collection. Some books, he said, might not survive until the new
center is finished.
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he cited a copy of ``Le Maitre d'Hotel Francais,''
a cookbook written in 1822 by Antoine Careme, some of whose foldout
illustrations are tattered or missing altogether. He also mentioned
that one volume had been lost from Careme's five-volume ``L'Art de
la Cuisine Francais au 19th Siecle,'' published 145 years ago, and
other volumes have pages torn or missing.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3 representatives of the library agreed to begin moving
17th- and 18th-century cookery volumes from the annex to the rare
book room, where they will be more accessible. A maximum of 50
books (of perhaps 80) will be moved, joining some 25,000 historic
menus, one of the world's largest collections, in the rare book
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Coe gave us a very helpful list of rare books that are in
the general collection,'' Ms. Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, which will begin with ``Le Nouveau et Parfaict
Cuisinier'' (1668) by Pierre de Lune, is expected to take about a
year. The rest of the books will eventually be sent to Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The library has also agreed to allow scholars wishing to consult
works catalogued as ``V'' class, which accounts for most of the
culinary collections, to do so soon in the rare book room.
</P>
<P>
   As for the group's offer to raise money to try to save the
collection, Coe said that the library's directors did not encourage
special provisions for the culinary books. But, he said, the
library's development office is exploring ways to allow the group
to raise $100,000 for a curator to repair and restore materials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowen, the library's humanities director, said, ``If there
are people using our collections, and they have special concerns,
I'm willing to listen.''
