   To experience black history in progress, just step out the front
door. Look and listen. Almost every mode of pop music is grounded
in African American music forms. Everyday fashion statements such
as baggy jeans, flashy boxers and big, fat sneakers are direct
lifts from hip-hop couture. And much of our most fashionable
non-techie slanguage _ the kind that eventually makes it into
Webster's Dictionary _ hails from black America, not old Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When we stop to think, we remember these things. But we don't
stop to think often enough. That's where Black History Month comes
in. This four-week holiday of learning has been around since Carter
G. Woodson established it on Feb. 19, 1926 _ it was known then as
``Negro History Week'' _ but the possibilities for exploring its
richness have never been more diverse and accessible than they are
today.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet has opened the door to new ways of
researching the cultural contributions of African Americans. In
fact, there's so much information and so many resources out there
that it's easy to get lost. To help you on your way, we've provided
a starter list of sites documenting the black American journey.
Have an enlightening and rewarding trip.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Afro-America: The African American Newspapers Homepage &LR; 
( &LR; www.afroam.org &LR; ). A comprehensive site offering a link to its own
African American History Museum, a kids page, news, classifieds,
Web links to Africa, an art gallery and a community discussion
board.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The African American Mosaic &LR; 
( &LR; www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/intro.html &LR; ). This Library of
Congress research resource accompanies its African American
collections, but it stands alone as a meticulously documented
exploration into the African American experience from colonization,
slavery and abolition to the explosion of black arts in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; A Deeper Shade of History &LR; 
( &LR; www.ai.mit.edu/people/isbell/HFh &LR;   &LR; /black/bhist.html &LR; ). Part of
the larger ``Deeper Shade of Black'' site, this page offers a
splendid feature called ``This Day in Black History'' as well as a
search engine allowing users to investigate dates of interest to
them (what was happening on their birthdays, for example).
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Family Education Network: Black History Month &LR; 
( &LR; www.familyeducation.com/topic &LR; 
 &LR; /front/0,1156,1-4818,00.html?yah &LR; ). It may have an unwieldy URL,
but this is a good site for parents and kids to cruise together.
The easy-to-access design offers African American genealogy
resources, literature links, quizzes, polls and smart, informative
articles that avoid pandering to any particular age group.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The International Black Index Source Directory &LR; 
( &LR; www.blackindex.com &LR; ). An excellent site that greets visitors with
a cool blast from a swanky saxophone. In addition to a history
section with a huge library and a variety of search options, it
offers extensive links to Afrocentric articles on business,
entertainment and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; NetNoir &LR;  ( &LR; www.netnoir.com &LR; ). Chock-full of information and
resources for the international, interactive black community,
including everything from provocative editorials on Puff Daddy to a
list of daily inspirations. The focus here isn't in history past
tense, but in making history as you go.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The Harlem Renaissance &LR; 
( &LR; www.fatherryan.org/harlemrenaissance &LR; ). A primer on the genesis
of literature and fine arts in Harlem from 1920 to 1930. Includes a
historical overview and biographies of the era's most influential
writers and artists, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston
and Paul Robeson.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; We Shall Overcome &LR;  ( &LR; www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights &LR; ).
A national register of historic sites relating to the civil rights
movement. For those who want to relive the journey, it includes a
clickable itinerary map of the United States. There is an extensive
history of the movement as well as the strategies and people behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; Juneteenth World Wide Celebration &LR;  ( &LR; www.juneteenth.com &LR; ). A
site with information on African American Emancipation Day, first
celebrated on June 19, 1865. Includes a poetry section, links to
related sites, a guide to celebrations worldwide and an
``Empowerment Zone'' for news and announcements.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; African American Timeline &LR; 
( &LR; wanonline.com/blackhistory/1999/ &LR;   &LR; tl.html &LR; ). Created for Black
History Month 1999, this timeline begins in 1527 with events
leading up to African colonization and slavery and wraps up with
1997's Million Women March. Includes a quiz and a multimedia
section.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; BlackPlanet.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.blackplanet.com &LR; ). A great place for
the younger set. Attractions include everything from film and music
articles to news and career resources, chats and Web events. It
isn't necessarily grounded in the past, but it's a fun and valuable
online community resource.
