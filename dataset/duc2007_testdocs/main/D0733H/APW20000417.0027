<HEADLINE> America's Library Reaches 200  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As an idea goes, this one was small caliber,
just one of many administrative details that Congress had before it
in the spring of 1800 as it prepared to move to a new capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress
lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in
Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided for a decade,
there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.
</P>
<P>
   That the library would grow into a pre-eminent world institution
was beyond imagination.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, 1800, President John Adams approved an
appropriation of $5,000 to purchase ''such books as may be
necessary for the use of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Books, mostly on history, economics and law, were ordered from
London. They arrived in 1801 and were shelved in the new U.S.
Capitol. The collection consisted of just 740 volumes and three
maps.
</P>
<P>
   Next Monday, millions of books and much history later, the
Library of Congress celebrates its 200th anniversary as an
institution that grew, in the words of one of its biographers, into
''a symbol of American democracy and faith in the power of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration includes a major exhibition, ''Thomas
Jefferson,'' featuring the first-ever reassembly of Jefferson's
1815 library in one place, arranged by the system he devised. A
commemorative stamp and two coins will be issued. A new Web site
for families, ''America's Library,'' will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   When it still amounted to little more than a few books on a few
shelves the library had the good fortune to capture the interest of
the one American with perhaps more interest in books than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot live without books ...,'' Thomas Jefferson wrote in
1815.
</P>
<P>
   As president in 1802, Jefferson approved the first law setting
out the role and functions of the new library. While the law gave
Congress the authority to set the library's budget, it awarded the
appointment of the Librarian of Congress to the president. That
gave the new institution a government-wide reach.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1814, an invading British army intervened. It seized
Washington and burned the White House and the Capitol. The Library
of Congress, which by then had about 3,000 volumes, was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   With one act, Jefferson became the founder of the Library of
Congress as it now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learn from the newspapers that the vandalism of our enemy
has triumphed at Washington over science as well as the arts, by
the destruction of the public library with the noble edifice in
which it was deposited,'' Jefferson wrote in a letter that
September.
</P>
<P>
   By then retired to his home at Monticello, Jefferson offered
Congress the opportunity to buy his private library which then
totaled nearly 6,500 volumes. The purchase was approved. The price
was almost $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson called it the ''choicest collection of books in the
U.S.'' He voiced hope it would have a permanent influence ''on the
literature of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Jefferson's books was a step in that direction. It
offered the Library of Congress the chance of establishing a
comprehensive, universal collection.
</P>
<P>
   When delivered in a caravan of horse-pulled wagons, Jefferson's
library expanded the breadth of the collection dramatically. It
added books on architecture, the arts, science, literature and
geography.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed that the American legislature needed ideas and
information on all subjects and in many languages in order to
govern a democracy,'' writes library historian John Y. Cole in
''Jefferson's Legacy, A Brief History of the Library of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the argument that his collection might be too
comprehensive, Jefferson argued that there was ''no subject to
which a member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting editorially on July 15, 1815, ''The National
Intelligencer,'' Washington's first newspaper, said: ''In all
civilized nations of Europe there are national libraries ... In a
country of such general intelligence as this, the congressional or
national Library of the United States (should) become the great
repository of the literature of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Monticello, his hilltop home in Virginia, Jefferson quickly
began to restock his own empty shelves, telling John Adams that now
he was retired from public life he was reading more for amusement
and pleasure than for practical use.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died in 1826, he had more than 1,000 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The institution he rescued also never stopped collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jefferson gave us the rationale for today's library,'' says
Cole who is also director of the Library's Center for the Book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the library is a world library,'' he said. ''We serve
the world and we collect the world.''
