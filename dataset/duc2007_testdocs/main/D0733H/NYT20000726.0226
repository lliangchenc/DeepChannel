<P>
   The Library of Congress is charged with collecting the creative
work of the American people. This has come to include such varied
output as the papers of Thomas Jefferson and the Wright brothers,
the original compositions of Leonard Bernstein and the video
archives of the Martha Graham Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's creativity now extends to Web sites, electronic
journals and magazines, and CD-ROMs of every sort, and the library
has fallen behind in collecting and archiving that digital
material, according to a report released on Wednesday by the
National Academy of Sciences. Unless its administrators act
swiftly, the report says, the library will risk diminishing
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The 260-page report is the most comprehensive overview to date
of the Library of Congress' digital preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's creativity is at this point significantly
represented by what's happening electronically,'' said James
O'Donnell, vice provost of information systems and computing at the
University of Pennsylvania and chairman of the committee that
produced the National Academy's report. The committee included
outside experts in digital libraries, databases, computer
networking and digital preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep the mission of the library what it has been, the
change in the landscape brought about by networked information is
dramatic and brings about unavoidable challenges for the library,''
O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges are, of course, shared by scores of other
research libraries faced with the task of collecting, making
accessible and preserving the nation's assorted electronica:
scholarly journals, books and magazines published in electronic
form; multimedia products like CD-ROMs; digital photographs, music
and films; and millions of miscellaneous pieces of Internet-based
material.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the report stated, there are built-in limits to the
library's ability to respond quickly to trends: As a creature of
Congress, it is often mired in governmental bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it saw ``signs that the library is already
losing the momentum and purchase required to make the next steep
ascent'' to respond to the new challenges ``in a timely and
effective way.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is inadequate infrastructure. The library urgently
needs a sophisticated system for receiving and managing digital
documents deposited with the library and registered for copyright.
The library also needs to recruit and retain computer experts from
a field already suffering a labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The report also emphasized the need for the library to
collaborate with other national libraries and institutions. Ann
Okerson, a committee member who is associate university librarian
at Yale University, said: ``At a time when we are trying to build
large, interconnected systems, it is unlikely that a single
institution could create such complicated systems independently of
other key players. That goes for the Library of Congress or any
other large library or organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee expressed less concern over the library's ongoing
efforts to make digital copies of items in its physical collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digitizing your analog material is less urgent,'' O'Donnell
said. ``You can manage that by asking: `What's there a need for?
Why should it be made digital?' But if you don't do it this year,
it'll still be there in five years, and you could do it then.
Digital information that you're losing is probably lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, who commissioned
the study two years ago, said he was encouraged by the committee's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as extremely positive that they are stressing the
importance of this,'' Billington said in an interview. He pointed
out that a Digital Futures group within the library is already at
work on many of the problems pinpointed by the National Academy
report. But the report, he said, brings a renewed sense of urgency
to the situation. ``We've seen that this is a problem, and we now
have a strong reinforcement for doing something on it at a more
accelerated rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a set of recommendations only, and the library is
not required to act on them. Margaret Hedstrom, a committee member
who is an associate professor in the School of Information at the
University of Michigan, said, ``I suppose to some degree, a test of
how serious they are is which of them they act on, and how soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Billington said one of the main obstacles to carrying out the
report's recommendations is financing. In its 2001 budget request,
the library asked for a $21 million increase for digital archiving,
but the actual increase will probably fall far short of that. ``A
major unresolved issue is how to fund this effort,'' Billington
said.  &QL;

<P>
   Private partnerships are one answer. Six years ago, the library
embarked on the National Digital Library Program, paid for in large
part by corporations, foundations and individual donors. By the end
of this year, the library will have placed 5 million of its 119
million items on its American Memory site (memory.loc.gov), for use
by the public. The site gets more than 4 million hits each day,
most of them from schoolchildren who go there to view artifacts
like old baseball cards, Lincoln's papers and historic pamphlets
from the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
</P>
<P>
   A few other pieces of the digital puzzle are falling into place.
The library has preserved many of its digital resources, including
the full-text databases of the Thomas system for legislative
information and its own bibliographic databases.
</P>
<P>
   The library has an extensive collection of CDs and CD-ROMs, and
it is about to sign an agreement with the American Physical
Society, which will regularly deposit its eight online physics
journals. The library is also referring researchers to databases
that serve as portals to specialized sources of online information,
including the table of contents of 10,000 journals and the full
text of every doctoral dissertation written in the United States
since 1861.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the rapid clip at which digital information of all
kinds is proliferating has caught the Library of Congress largely
unprepared,'' O'Donnell said. ``The sheer quantity of networked
information is astonishing, and it keeps increasing at astonishing
rates.''  &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the course of studying the library's digital future,
committee members pondered some fundamental questions. What, for
instance, constitutes a publication? And what really deserves to be
saved?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept that the Internet should also be collected, what
does that mean?'' asked Ginnie Cooper, director of libraries for
the Multnomah County Library in Portland, Ore., and a committee
member. ``Today's Internet? Tomorrow's? All? And do you collect
just the first layer of a Web page and none of the links? Three
layers? Ten?''
</P>
<P>
   The library applies the same criteria to digital material that
it applies to physical material, Davenport said. ``We say, `If you
would have been selecting it in physical form, then select it,'''
she said. ``The format does not make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Merely archiving digital material isn't enough, however. The
Library of Congress and other research libraries are wrestling with
the problem of finding an effective means of preserving it. Much
digital material is actually more vulnerable than its
acid-free-paper counterparts. That is because computer hardware and
software quickly become obsolete, and the durability of magnetic
storage media like tapes and disks is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based documents that are filled with links pose yet another
preservation problem because keeping an electronic research paper
vital and relevant means keeping its links alive.
</P>
<P>
   Billington said the library is looking into a number of
preservation methods.
</P>
<P>
   In general, O'Donnell said, ``I think they've done a worthy job
of thinking their way through some pilots, saying, `Let's dip our
toe firmly into the water and see what we can do.' We say, `We
applaud that, but now it's time to jump in.'''
