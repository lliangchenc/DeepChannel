   WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson, which is the
highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as
a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation, has
been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for
their campaign for classroom prayer, taxpayer-financed vouchers for
religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library's analysis
of Jefferson's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used
in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a
famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist
Association in 1802. In it, the nation's third president coined the
phrase ``wall of separation between Church and State.'' Jefferson's
letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century
to describe the proper relationship between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress' analysis of the Jefferson letter,
released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson,
chief of the library's manuscript division, asserted that Jefferson
never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law, but
instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England
constituents. Hutson's analysis said: ``The Danbury Baptist Letter
was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental
principles; it was meant to be a political manifesto, nothing
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson's
``wall'' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an
overarching principle. The Christian Coalition immediately issued a
news release headlined ``Library of Congress Skewers `Wall of
Separation' Myth,'' and said the library's findings should bolster
the campaign for the ``religious freedom amendment.'' The magazine
of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry, called Jefferson's
wall ``flimsy.'' Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote
that Jefferson's words had been ``twisted by liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio
to the ivory tower, when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a
letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the
Jefferson letter was misleading and ``unbalanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned for really one fundamental reason,'' said
Robert Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of
Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the
library. ``If you're going to be the keeper of the precious
documents of the nation, you ought not to put them on display with
biased analysis, and certainly not with a paper that has not been
read by its peers and judged for its qualities, and with as many
egregious observations of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the Library of Congress, Hutson, caretaker of
the library's manuscripts for 16 years, said he was amazed that a
brief paper he wrote as a ``press primer'' without footnotes had
been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on
constitutional law,'' Hutson said, his face flushing.

   Hutson is 61, a Presbyterian churchgoer, a Yale graduate and an
expert on Benjamin Franklin. He said he was chagrined that the
uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he
painstakingly collected for the exhibition. He said he would not
repudiate the thesis of his paper, but added, ``Maybe I should have
been more careful, but I really did try to guard against anything
like this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the
blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson's letter to the
Danbury Baptist Association. The final version says that ``religion
is a matter which lies solely between Man &AMP; his God, that he owes
account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the
legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &AMP; not
opinions.'' Jefferson restated the First Amendment's religion
clause, and followed with the words ``thus building a wall of
separation between Church and State.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover
the inked-out words in Jefferson's letter, just as the bureau had
done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt's.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hutson was performing excavation on a document that
is a touchstone of American history. The ``wall of separation''
metaphor, though not found in the Constitution, is often invoked as
shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which says that ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The import of the ``separation'' language has been argued over
by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing
with the relationship between government and religion. The Supreme
Court declared in Reynolds vs. United States in 1878 that the
``wall'' metaphor was ``almost an authoritative declaration of the
scope and effect'' of the First Amendment. Since then, justices
like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that
Jefferson's words were misused.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word
``eternal'' preceding ``separation of Church and State'' _ as some
scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over ``the
duties of my station, which are merely temporal.'' That last word
meant secular, as opposed to spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   In his essay, Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these
phrases because they might sound ``too anti-religious to pious New
England ears.'' Jefferson's letter, dated Jan. 1, 1802, was meant
to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut, who were suffering
persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state.
Jefferson also wrote that as president, he would not proclaim
national feast days and thanksgivings. But Hutson said that
Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it
might offend potential political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter, Jefferson
attended church services held in the House of Representatives,
Hutson wrote, which was ``his way of offering symbolic support for
religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Randy Tate, executive director of the
Christian Coalition, embraced Hutson's findings, saying, ``Some in
the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious
expression in the public square, and I think that runs counter to
what Thomas Jefferson meant.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barton, president of WallBuilders, a group that says it
aims to restore biblical values in public policy, said, ``The
library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying,
that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash followed. In June, Barry Lynn, executive director
of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy
group in Washington, asked the library to declare Hutson's research
``merely one opinion,'' with which Lynn said most scholars
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the 24 scholars, written by them but faxed to
the library by Americans United, lambasted Hutson's basic
contention that Jefferson's letter was a matter of politics and not
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. O'Neill, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a
professor of law at the University of Virginia, who helped draft
the scholars' letter, said, ``The fact that there may have been a
political context for Jefferson's letter hardly disqualifies it as
an assertion of principle, especially since it is so consistent
with everything else he did or said on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy may reverberate in the courts, said Daniel
Dreisbach, an associate professor of justice at American
University. ``I'll bet you my house,'' he said, that some judges,
faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps,
will say, ``We shouldn't be basing constitutional law on the
Danbury letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is now closed in Washington, and will soon travel
to Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The library, whose staff members say they are not accustomed to
such controversy, is now trying to calm the furor. In a letter in
response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over
the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the
many materials that it presents to the public.''
