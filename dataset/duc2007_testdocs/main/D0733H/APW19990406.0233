<HEADLINE> Poet Laureate Pinsky Gets 3rd Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's ninth poet laureate is getting a  
third, unprecedented year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pinsky, who teaches creative writing at Boston  
University, doesn't have the official wine allowance that Britain's 
poet laureate has been entitled to ever since Shakespeare's 
drinking friend, Ben Jonson, took the job in 1616. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard that they're going to abolish all that medieval  
nonsense, give him a one-year term like we have and put him on a 
salary,'' Pinsky said Monday about the British poet laureate, who 
serves for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Hughes, Britain's last poet laureate, died last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky, 58, is the ninth American laureate since Congress  
created the title in 1985. He was reappointed to a third year 
Monday by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky has been especially active, appearing in public and on  
TV, emphasizing poetry as part of life -- even poems composed with 
words on refrigerator magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	He will preside Wednesday at two readings at the library, one  
for youngsters of school age and one for prominent Washingtonians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to have Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's  
representative in Congress and William S. Cohen, the defense 
secretary, to read their favorites,'' Pinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is a novelist, but Pinsky said he didn't know if the  
defense secretary had written any poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky has been pushing a project in which President Clinton,  
other prominent people and ordinary Americans are asked to read 
their favorite poems aloud. About 1,000 audio and 200 video 
recordings will be made. They will be deposited in the Library of 
Congress as a record of how Americans felt about poetry at the turn 
of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Next April, Pinsky will take a major part in a conference on  
``Poetry and the American People,'' celebrating the library's 200th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky gets an assistant, an office at the library and $35,000 a  
year. His allowance comes from privately collected money, as does 
$20,000 each for three special consultants he will have for the 
first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultants will be Rita Dove, a former poet laureate, and  
Louise Gluck and W.S. Merwin, both also well-known as poets.
