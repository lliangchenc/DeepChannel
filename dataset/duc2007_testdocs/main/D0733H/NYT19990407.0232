   WASHINGTON _ In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to
start building a national library without walls.
</P>
<P>
   The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress'
huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the
country could have access to the material without traveling to
Washington or even leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, said Laura Campbell, a Library of Congress
official, the only media suitable to the task were the video disk
and the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the distribution business,'' Ms. Campbell said.
``How could we get this out?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ms. Campbell said, those were ``the days before the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the World Wide Web had evolved, making it easy for even
casual computer users to gain access to information on the
Internet. The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought
contributions to help put its holdings on line.
</P>
<P>
   The library solicited a donation from David Packard, the
co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who knows something of computers.
``He said he loved the idea of getting this information out,'' Ms.
Campbell said. ``He gave us our first $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Metromedia chairman John Kluge gave $5 million, and the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation contributed $3 million. The $13 million in
donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it
has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from
the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to the collection, which is stored on a server at
the library, is the Library of Congress' American Memory site
(memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html). It drew 132,000 unique
visitors, or people who went to the site at least once, during
February, said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix, an Internet
measurement company. By comparison, the Library of Congress' main
government page, Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), which provides access to
every part of the federal government, got 249,000 unique visitors
that month, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitive strength,'' Ms. Campbell said, ``is that we
have these unique and rare treasures to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   A person skimming through the offerings the other day clicked
into World War I material. First there was a recording of George M.
Cohan's ``Over There,'' sung by Billy Murray in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a recording from the U.S. commander in France, Gen.
John J. Pershing, who recorded a 33-second speech called ``From the
Battlefields of France'' in which he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three thousand miles from home, an American army is fighting
for you. Everything you hold worthwhile is at stake. Only the
hardest blows can win against the enemy we are fighting. Invoking
the spirit of our forefathers, the army asks your unshrinking
support, to the end that the high ideals for which America stands
may endure upon the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was easy to navigate to a collection of World War
I photographs, one of them showing a German zeppelin brought down
in an English field.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell, who is director of the library's National Digital
Library and directs a staff of 100 people, said there were now 1.7
million items on the Web site. The goal is to have 5 million by
next year, the library's bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from
the Library of Congress' collection that cannot be easily obtained
elsewhere. A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about
every American library, so books like that will not be made
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What will be made available are materials like the earliest
movies and sound recordings, maps, manuscripts, the papers of 23
presidents and photographs. Fragile rare books are also being put
online; less handling means that they will probably last longer.
Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital.
</P>
<P>
   One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1855 letter praising
Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' in which the established
Emerson called the little-known Whitman's work ``the most
extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet
contributed,'' according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Without asking permission, Whitman used Emerson's testimonial in
advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry,
including some in which he added erotic elements. Emerson was not
pleased, the entry adds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Library of Congress site, a teacher of a history course
on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not
only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier
draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by
Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The American Memory site has Civil War photographs by Matthew
Brady and others (a picture taken by Alexander Gardner shows
Confederate dead at Antietam in 1862), the earliest authenticated
daguerreotype portrait of Abraham Lincoln (taken by Nicholas H.
Sheperd in 1846 or 1847), turn-of-the-century films of New York
street scenes (in one a horse-drawn fire engine races around a
corner) and Alexander Graham Bell's 1876 sketch of the telephone,
without which none of this would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also
meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its
potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school
libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress can get its material in the most
unexpected ways. A collection of early baseball cards, which can be
seen on the American Memory site, was gathered by Benjamin K.
Edwards, who left it to his daughter, who gave it to the poet Carl
Sandburg, who donated it to the library.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards, produced
from 1887 to 1914, and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb, Cy Young,
Connie Mack, Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson. In those days,
most of the cards were distributed with cigarettes and were used
for both advertising and for stiffening the packages.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program
to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms. The
program, called American Memory Fellows, sends 50 teachers to
Washington for a week each summer and trains them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here,''
Ms. Campbell said, ``and then give a commitment to continue to work
with us and make primary sources available in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers who have participated in the program's first two
years, Ms. Campbell said, ``are spreading the word'' about the
library on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Veccia, project manager for the National Digital Library,
said that the fellows for this year had been selected already. ``If
money is available, we will have it in years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about applying for the fellowships can be obtained
by selecting the Learning Page on the American Memory home page and
then clicking on Educators' Program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the fellows were chosen, Ms. Veccia said that the
Library of Congress sought teachers ``who come with an idea of how
they are going to use it, who have some facility with the
technology _ we really can't be teaching technology skills at this
point _ and who are leaders in their fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and
accommodations while here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the
Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes
and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its own collection, the Library of Congress plans to put
other institutions' materials on the American Memory site. It has
received $2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with
material from the New-York Historical Society (which has provided
its Civil War collection) and the Chicago Historical Society (the
holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News, a defunct
newspaper with a notable sports collection).
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 200 years, the Library of Congress has been
notable for its collection of books. Does this emphasis on
electronic media mark a basic shift in emphasis?
</P>
<P>
   No, answered Robert Zich, the director of the project's
electronic programs, it is really a way to whet the appetite.
Speaking of the Librarian of Congress, he said, ``Billington's goal
is to drive kids back to the libraries and reading books.''
