   SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William
King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man,
begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's
history of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial,
as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law
Center demonstrates. According to the report, the number of hate
groups in the country increased again last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our
society's fabric. They give rise to the environment that fostered
King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own
in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison
inmate. In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will
rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed
in the blood of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is that King is only 24. He didn't evolve
overnight into the monster that killed Byrd. Neither did his moral
moorings come loose in a vacuum. King's hate steadily was fed,
tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head:
a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with
horns; Nazi symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how
King might have arrived at this point.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate
crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia Beach, Va., a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to
trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a
student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and
King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate
flag belt buckle. The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku
Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave
his buckle at home.
</P>
<P>
   While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to
humanity. For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on
their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
</P>
<P>
   Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but
groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other
separatist organizations. And, make no mistake, they're hungry for
more recruits. Their new tool, according to the law center, is the
Internet. Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can
reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but
increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing
recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the
number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997. The Southern Poverty
Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups
from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Take a good look. This is how John William King learned to hate.
Right under our noses. In our back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) something that is a virus,'' Jasper County District
Attorney James Gray told jurors in closing arguments last week.
``It's something that's dangerous. It's something that spreads from
one person to another.''
</P>
<P>
   But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by
challenging those who espouse it. Byrd's murder is all the
motivation we need.
