   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights
organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest
white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a
state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan
Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two
years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's
compound near here.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of
the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were
ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the
nine-woman, three-man jury.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai
County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a
mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their
lawyers. The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,
even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has
successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's
finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one
that could force the group out of its 19-acre property. ``We intend
to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and
forever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was
announced. ``We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and
hopefully, through the judicial pro- cess, close a sad chapter in
this na- tion's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Butler and the Aryan Nations were liable for
$4.8 million and Teague was lia- ble for $600,000. The guards were
liable for most of the remaining amount.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of
message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly
sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called
North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself
to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of
Independence who were harassed for their views. ``This is
nothing,'' he said, after the verdict. ``We have planted seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money. We will
spread the message.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the group said an appeal was planned.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of group's assets re- mained unclear, raising
questions about whether Butler and his followers, whose numbers
have been described by the local authorities as dwindling, would
pay anything close to the full amount if the award is upheld.
Nonetheless, Dees vowed that it was the beginning of the end for
the group and that the verdict was a rebuke of the Aryan Nations
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  leaders, who were technically found to be
negligent in the training and supervision of the security guards
who carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now
21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the
Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12
million in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan
Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of
racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will
be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees
said in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day
trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,
he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of
drunken young men.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of
violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the
jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly
politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts
and all manner of people that drift in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near
the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden
Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a
wedding. They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had
accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun. He had been in the Job
Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim
and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. He quickly retrieved
the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the
police after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police
that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant
Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the
car. They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the
car into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,
struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and
screamed at her. She and her son testified that they thought they
were going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that
one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian. She testified
that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor
white farm girl.'' A guard then said that because they were white,
the men would let them go.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified
that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the
other men had fired at the Keenans. Under questioning, Yeager read
portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance
to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to
ever walk the face of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and
are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a
fugitive. The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial
and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point
repeated by Steele.
