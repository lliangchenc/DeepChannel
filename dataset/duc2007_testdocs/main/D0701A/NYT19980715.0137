   It's been six years since Sinead O'Connor earned a permanent
place in the Hall of Fierce when she shredded a photograph of Pope
John Paul II, and intoned, ``Fight the real enemy,'' on ``Saturday
Night Live.'' Sure, she evoked the wrath of Catholics, including a
hypocritical Madonna. But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an
industry lousy with pretense. Here was a beautiful woman who
desexualized herself by shaving her head, a fiesty zealot with the
voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine. She
championed Public Enemy, flipped off the Grammys, and was
threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled
Banner. Her actions were so jaw-droppingly over, it was hard not to
admire their raw loopiness, though they overshadowed her talent and
undermined record sales.

   Now 31 and twice a mother, O'Connor seems a bit less prickly. In
the current  &UR; Spin &LR; , O'Connor, on the road this suumer as part of
the Lilith Fair, tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets
about actions which brought her grief in the past. ``I respect
myself for being the age that I was and having this passion and
integrity that I did have,'' she says. ``I can say about the Pope
thing, I'm very proud of that and I stand by it and I would do it
again. Quite a lot of the other things _ like the national anthem
and the Grammys _ I wouldn't do now because they're just
(expletive) young moody (expletive).'' Likewise, she has little
regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a
fashion accessory. ``I suppose it bothers me that people like them
have sold a lot more records than I ever sold. They don't cause
trouble and they play a game. They're not controversial in any
way.''

   Speaking of playing games, is Jesse Camp for real? Is Camp,
anointed the newest idiot in MTV's village after beating 4,000
others in the network's ``I Wanna Be a VJ'' contest in April,
really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one
of his wool leg warmers over our eyes? It seems like it may be the
latter. His dad, J. Holden Camp, chairman of the humanities
department at the University of Hartford, tells Spin his son, whose
real name is Josh, ``is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a
facade. He did well in school, and he had a lot of fun with
drama.'' Looks like he still is.

   &UR; P.O.V. &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the men's magazine which is Details without urban
cool or female readership, continues to genuflect to the guilt-free
guyness which (thankfully) hasn't been on public display since
Frank, Dean, and Sammy rampaged through the Sands Hotel. You can
practically smell aftershave on every page. So in addition to a
vodka primer _ Ketel One gets a A+ for its ``exceptionally clean
finish _ there's Scott Bindley's entertaining mini-opus, ``In
Defense of Bachelorhood.'' According to Bindley, married life can
be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers, minivans, and sex
as often as the World Cup. Hence, men should be live it up as
bachelors. Singledom, he says, means more time and money for a cool
sports car, titanium golf clubs, and a satellite dish which can get
every sporting event from Little League to logrolling. But Bindley
is quick to say everything he writes ``is predicated on the belief
that the bachelor existence should be temporary. We are not
advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa's
He-Man Women-Haters Club.''

   The women of  &UR; Bust &LR;  seem like they couldn't care less if they
make men uncomfortable. This smart New York-based quarterly is
dedicated to celebrating all things female, and if the boys can't
handle it, well, they don't have to go home, but they've got to the
heck the out of here. In short, chicks rule. This month's edition
is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help
us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the
Lavernes to our Shirleys. There's Donna Lovell's too-true feature,
``Six Reasons Why Your Girlfriend is Better Than a Boyfriend,'' and
``Bosom Buddies,'' a funny meditation of the best girlfriends of
all time, including Lucy and Ethel, Cagney and Lacy, Patsy and
Edina of the late great ``Absolutely Fabulous.''

   For nearly a decade, Queen Latifah, the first lady of hip-hop,
has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether she prefers
princesses to princes in her queendom. Speculation on her sexuality
only intensified after she played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996
urban caper ``Set It Off.'' So in the current issue of  &UR; The Source,
 &LR; she pumps ``Order in the Court,'' her first CD in five years, and
gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls. Mostly, though, she
talks about those rumors. ``I have no problems with my sexuality,
whatever you wanna think I am,'' the woman born Dana Owens tells
writer Amy Linden. ``I'll never answer the question. I'd rather
have you die wanting to know. You can assume whatever you want. I'm
me. I'm not ashamed of who I am, and who I sleep with is nobody's
businesses.'' Which is very similar to what George Michael used to
say before he came out earlier this year _ not that there's
anything wrong with that.

   In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column. Dees
has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful
activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation. But
then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC's list of hate groups.
Writes Brett Johnson, ``If you want to make friends and influence
people in the 'hood, dissing (Louis) Farrakhan and the Nation is
not the place to start.'' Perhaps. But since Farrakhan has made
anti-Semitic remarks, as well as homophobic and misogynistic
comments, he belongs on Dees's list. So to the Source, that slap is
right back at 'cha.
