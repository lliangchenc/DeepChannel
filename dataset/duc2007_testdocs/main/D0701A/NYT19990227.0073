COMMENTARY: STARING AT HATRED  
(DW)

   How deep is the hatred?
</P>
<P>
   After being sentenced to death in Jasper, Texas, last week, John
William King was asked if he had anything to say to the relatives
of his victim, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was
chained to a pickup truck and dragged along a country road until
his body literally was torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, did have something to
say. Grinning, he assured all within earshot that Byrd's grieving
survivors were welcome to perform a sex act on him.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would like to believe that the attack on Byrd was
an aberration, that it was so far over the top, so sick and
inhumane, that it should not be viewed as representative of a much
larger societal problem. The reasoning is more or less as follows:
The vast majority of Americans were repelled by the murder, arrests
were made quickly, and the legal steps toward the ultimate societal
sanction already are being taken. Let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude presupposes that race hatred and other forms of
prejudice and intolerance in America are not nearly as deep or as
dangerous as the attack on Byrd might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A long litany of tragedies tells us otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student in Wyoming, died
last fall after he was kidnapped, robbed, tied to a fence, beaten
in the head with a .357 Magnum, tortured with cigarettes, taunted
as he wept and begged for his life, and finally left alone and
helpless in near-freezing temperatures. Authorities said he was
murdered, at least in part, because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate crimes and hate groups across
the country, is filled with other horrible examples that occurred
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the report said, a dark-haired young woman named
Amy Robinson was abducted in Fort Worth, Texas, and murdered by two
white men who used her for target practice. They were reported to
have burst out laughing when she died. The original plan, according
to one of the men, was ``to go out and shoot black folks.'' Ms.
Robinson was chosen because the men thought she was biracial. They
were mistaken. Ms. Robinson was, in fact, white.
</P>
<P>
   In October in Buffalo, N.Y., a group of black teen-agers
attacked a 41-year-old white man, Gary Trzaska, as he was walking
to his car. Trzaska, who was gay, was beaten and stomped to death.
Witnesses said they saw the teen-agers jumping high in the air so
they could land on Trzaska's head with both feet. They said the
boys appeared gleeful.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring a group of whites ``armed with brass knuckles and
chanting `white power''' attacked Lance Cpl. Carlos Colbert, a
21-year-old black Marine, as he left a party in San Diego, Calif.
As many as 30 men joined in the assault. Colbert was not killed,
but his neck was broken. He is paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   Last May a racially charged exchange in a bar led to the murder
of Mark Dale Butts, a 35-year-old white man. He was beaten to death
in a cemetery in Victor, Colo., by a group of black men and
teen-agers. A shovel was used in the attack. Authorities said Butts
was beaten so hard the handle of the shovel eventually broke.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Law Center, said he
is surprised by what appears to be the increasing frequency and
viciousness of such attacks. They are being committed by whites and
blacks, he said. Much of the hatred is fueled by the growing number
of organized hate groups and the proliferation of Internet sites
devoted to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder
of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex., is understandable. Once justice is
done, what's the point of wallowing in the hideousness of the
crime?
</P>
<P>
   But there is a need to understand the rage and the frustrations
and the impulses that lead so many to mayhem in the name of some
warped sense of superiority, or inadequacy, or fear, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging someone to his death behind a truck may be unusual. But
torturing, maiming and killing people because they fit a certain
despised profile is an everyday occurrence. We can hardly stop it
if we're not even willing to look at it.
