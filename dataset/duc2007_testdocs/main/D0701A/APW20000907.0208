<HEADLINE> Jury: Aryans To Pay $6.3M in Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY

   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A jury on Thursday awarded $6.3
million to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations
guards outside the white supremacist group's north Idaho
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler, the
group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc., were negligent in
the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who
assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans' attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award
more than $11 million in punitive damages. Dees, of the Montgomery,
Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the
penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom,
comparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring
northern Idaho a haven for racists.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing,'' Butler said. ''We have planted seeds. Most
of north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped
multiculturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000
in compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at
and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet
near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin
disposing of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to enforce this verdict. We intend to take every
single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' he said.
''We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully,
through the judicial process, close that sad chapter in this
nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Keenan, 44, spoke briefly, thanking the jury, her
lawyers and her family. ''Without them, I don't think I could have
done all this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said
he will move for a new trial. If that fails, he will appeal and may
also seek to have the judgment amount reduced. Butler would have to
post a $9 million bond to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this area to be one of the last bastions of free
speech in America,'' Steele said. ''You can write the epitaph for
that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc. 90
percent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.
Butler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent
negligent and liable for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The former guards Jesse Warfield and John Yeager -- who are
serving prison terms for the assaults on the Keenans -- were also
found liable for punitive damages. Yeager was assessed $100,000 in
punitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan
$80,000 in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not
responsible. Steele said that Warfield and Yeager were drunk --
against regulations -- when they attacked the Keenans on the evening
of July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took
responsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to
implicate Butler. They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire
from the Keenans and perceived a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield,
Yeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.
The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures
in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who
founded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford
Furrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing
an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care
center last summer.
</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes. The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups. In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building. In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.
