<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations May Meet in Pa.  </HEADLINE>

   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Facing eviction from its compound in
northern Idaho, the Aryan Nations may move its annual white
supremacist gathering to Pennsylvania next year.
</P>
<P>
   The news was posted on the neo-Nazi group's Web site Friday, a
week after the group was slapped with a $6.3 million judgment in a
civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is scheduled to be seized on Sept. 29 and the
assets sold to satisfy a portion of the judgment due to two people
who sued the group after they were assaulted by Aryan Nations'
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The notice was the first indication that the lawsuit, brought by
the Southern Poverty Law Center, may drive the group out of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been asked if I would continue to host the yearly
National Congress and my answer was, of course, an astounding
YES!'' wrote August B. Kreis III, Web master for the Aryan Nations
and a Posse Comitatus leader in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis wrote that if the compound is lost, the Aryan Nations
''National Congress 2001'' would be planned for a site near
Ulysses, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler declined to talk with
reporters Friday. He is appealing the judgment to the Idaho Supreme
Court, but that appeal is not expected to halt the seizure of the
group's 20-acre compound north of Hayden Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs'
legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end
to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.
</P>
<P>
   Butler moved to northern Idaho from California in 1973, and
began holding an annual event called the Aryan Nations Congress in
1981. The gatherings drew white supremacists from across the nation
to hear speeches and participate in cross burnings and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County Sheriff Rocky Watson has said his officers will
seize the Aryan Nations compound on Sept. 29. The sheriff's office
will store the contents and eventually hold a sale, with the money
going to Victoria and Jason Keenan, who filed the lawsuit, and
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury ruled that Butler, his organization and its
corporate entity, Saphire Inc., were negligent in selecting and
overseeing security guards who attacked the Keenans in 1998.
