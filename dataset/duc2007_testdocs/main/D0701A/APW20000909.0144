<HEADLINE> Butler: Racists To Stay in Idaho  </HEADLINE>

   HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho (AP) -- Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler
vowed Saturday he will not leave northern Idaho, despite a $6.3
million judgment against his racist organization.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound,
Butler said he did not have the $960,000 in cash bond that would be
required for him to appeal the judgment issued Thursday by a civil
jury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his neo-Nazi sect would continue, even if the
compound is seized to pay the judgment as he expects.
</P>
<P>
   ''They cannot run me out of northern Idaho with my tail between
my legs,'' Butler said from a church pulpit, standing next to a
silver bust of Adolf Hitler. He said he may seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found that Butler and his organization were negligent in
selecting and overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria
Keenan and her son Jason in 1998. Jurors awarded the damages to the
Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped
their car near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., represented the Keenans and has said he intends
to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment,
including the sect's name.
</P>
<P>
   Butler compared his trial to trials in the former Soviet Union
under dictator Josef Stalin. He said local ''politicians want to
improve the image of Idaho by mongrelizing the white race up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Idaho politicians and community leaders expressed hope after
last week's judgment that Butler would leave the area and take his
organization with him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Butler, 82, has applied for a permit to hold another
parade down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in October.
</P>
<P>
   He bemoaned the expected loss of the compound, which he bought
nearly 30 years ago and includes his home and church and has been
the site of annual gatherings by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place was built on love,'' Butler said. ''It is a place
to worship with your own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that two wealthy computer industry
executives who have been supportive of Butler in recent years might
come to his financial aid. But Butler said Saturday that he has not
asked Vincent Bertollini or Carl Story, both of Sandpoint, Idaho,
to pay the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have that kind of money,'' Butler said. ''We never
talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler also praised attorney Edgar Steele of Sandpoint for
taking his case, even though he said Steele did not share the Aryan
Nations' views.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mister Steele took the case for me out of his concern for
freedom of speech,'' Butler said. ''For the past two weeks, freedom
of speech has been on trial.''
