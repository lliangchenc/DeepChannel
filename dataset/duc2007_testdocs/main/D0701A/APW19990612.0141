	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A white supremacist arrested after buying  
hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail 
bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the  
Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a 
federal agent testified at a federal court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special  
agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might  
have been targeted in the national and state capital cities. An ATF 
representative did not immediately return calls for comment 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm  
found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was 
apparently a silencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam  
legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate ordered him held pending the results of a  
psychological evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison,  
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Bordenkircher. No charges were 
immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday,  
arriving with a loaded, cocked .45-caliber pistol on his hip and 
his 20-month-old son in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he wasn't quite right,'' Pasqualotto said.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam  
contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the  
FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver 
during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with 
civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern 
Poverty Law Center.
