WILBERT OLIVER, 89, WHO INFLUENCED FUNERAL-HOME POLICY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Wilbert Jean Oliver, whose 1973 federal lawsuit had the
practical effect of forcing funeral homes throughout the United
States to provide equal services to blacks and whites, died on
Tuesday at a hospital in Marksville, La. He was 89 and lived in
Mansura, La.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura, where he lived
all his life, for discrimination after it refused to provide
visitation for his deceased mother, Martha Pierre Oliver, because
she was black.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights
organization in Montgomery, Ala., advanced his case in federal
court, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers
Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks
or offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same prices
that they charged whites.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver won his case.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law
Center and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled
the case, said, ``Although the case was not binding, because it
never reached the Supreme Court, it served notice to funeral homes,
and even cemeteries and other businesses, that if they practiced
discrimination against blacks they could be violating federal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees said that after the ruling was announced, his organization
heard reports from across the country that previously segregated
funeral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``black funeral homes continue to
prosper in the South as a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaon Escude, a spokesman for the funeral home, said that his
grandfather, who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit,
provided all services, including embalming, but stopped at offering
visitation to blacks ``because, if he did, he thought he'd lose
business from whites.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his grandfather's competitors at the time would
not accept any black clients at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. August Thompson, who was Oliver's priest when his
mother died, said Oliver had been distraught when he was told that
the funeral home would not permit visitation for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived in what used to be called a shotgun house, because it
was so flimsy that if you fired a shotgun at the house it would go
right through it,'' Thompson said. ``He wanted a better place for
visitation for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Escude Funeral Home rejected his request, Oliver, a
salesman for John Deere, arranged to hold the wake in what was
described in his lawsuit as ``a run-down storage building on the
grounds of Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is survived by his wife, Catherine Carmouche Oliver of
Mansura; two sons, Wilbert Jr. of Chicago and Carroll of Kingwood,
Texas; a foster son, Francis Sarpy of Charleston, S.C.; six
daughters, Catherine Demouy and Jacqueline Batiste of Mansura,
Sister Laurita Oliver of New Orleans, Eloise Lee of DeRidder, La.,
Geraldine Barbin of Marksville and Hattie Turner of Alexandria,
La.; 39 grandchildren; 72 great-grandchildren, and 13
great-great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just an ordinary man, one of the common people and not
a crusader,'' Thompson said. ``Life was a little harder for him
because he had lost his left arm in an accident, but none of the
local lawyers would touch the case. I directed him to Julian Bond,
who was then president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Bond
took the case and within a month it was decided.''
