<HEADLINE> City Calls KKK a Terrorist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The city council has declared the Ku  
Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as well 
in a resolution approved after an emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was approved on a voice vote Tuesday after  
council members were assured it would not infringe on anyone's 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has a no-tolerance policy for terrorist  
organizations,'' said councilman Kwadjo Campbell. ``This is an 
unprecedented move, undoubtedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., said this may be the first municipality to 
designate the Klan a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly  
black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a 
$21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan 
members after the church was burned four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution only expresses the opinion of council and doesn't  
create law, city attorneys said. If the Klan wants to march, they 
may apply for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsor Wendell Gilliard had said when he first proposed the  
resolution that he wanted to prevent the Klan from holding rallies 
in the city. It has been several years since the group marched in 
Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a black thing. This is a human thing,'' Gilliard  
said. ``This is about race relations. This is about saving lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution says Charleston welcomes diverse opinions ``but  
not those views that instigate fear, bias, bigotry and hate.'' It 
condemns any organization ``whose purpose is to encourage hate of 
any individual, race, religion, culture or way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several council members were concerned the resolution could lead  
to lawsuits and a resumption of Klan marches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer letting the Klan die a natural death rather  
than cutting off their First Amendment rights,'' said Paul Tinkler. 
</P>
<P>
	Horace King, leader of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  
in South Carolina, refused to comment.
