COURTHOUSE KLAN-FIGHTER TAKES ON ARYAN NATIONS

<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series
of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist
groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court
here Monday to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has
nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son,
both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July
1998. The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan
Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan
Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his
second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable, on the
ground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and
encourage violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the assault, the guards said later, they thought
they were under armed attack by militant Jews. And in response to
the suit's accusation that he encourages violence, lawyers for
Butler maintain in court documents that ``demonizing Jews is still
legal under the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still legal in this country to be a bigot,'' the defense
says. ``It is still legal to hate. Pastor Butler quite properly
erects the twin defenses of both free speech and religion contained
within the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal
charges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be
called as witnesses for the plaintiffs. A third guard is a fugitive
in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Monday morning in the Kootenai County
Courthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled
the roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched
on the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now
21, told the police that they were driving home to the nearby town
of Sand Point from her niece's wedding at dusk on July 1, 1998,
playing music and having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he
threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and,
inadvertently, his wallet along with it. The wallet had been a gift
from his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and
drove back to look for it. Her son got out with a flashlight and
quickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized
that they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound, in
the community of Hayden Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her
1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did. Inside the compound,
Shane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a
gunshot. Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield,
then head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down
the compound's long driveway. John Yeager, a skinhead from
California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a
semiautomatic rifle. The Keenans fled, with the guards _ three or
more in all _ pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager, Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from an
assault rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her
to pull over. When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their
car slid into a ditch. Their pursuers ran up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said a man, later identified as Warfield, struck her with
a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her. Other
men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said,
striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   A gun ``was pointed at me,'' Keenan told the authorities. ``It
made me very scared. I thought I was going to die.'' She begged
them to leave her son alone. After determining that the Keenans
were unarmed, the men relented, explaining that they were doing so
because both were white, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the
assault, Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing
Butler, Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night
of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Butler
of their actions. ``Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of
bounds, and they knew it,'' Steele argued. ``One can only do so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Dees and his legal team were trying ``to paint this
ragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized,
well-trained and disciplined military organization.'' That, he
said, would be ``laughable if not so patently preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from
California, Butler and his organization have welcomed many white
supremacists later convicted of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a
terrorist group known as the Order. Mathews and members of his gang
robbed armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated
Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver. Mathews died in a
siege by the FBI in 1984, and other members of the organization are
serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were
arrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at
trial in Fort Smith, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania,
confessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan
Republican Army, that in the mid-1990s robbed 22 Midwestern banks
in an effort to finance a white supremacist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has
taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting
with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in
1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of
Michael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of
the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala. The group was forced to
turn its headquarters over to the victim's mother, and two Klansmen
were convicted of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the center won a large verdict against Klan groups and
members for an assault on peaceful civil rights marchers in Forsyth
County, Ga., on Jan. 17, 1987. The Invisible Empire, the major Klan
defendant, was forced to disband, and the group's office equipment
went to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the center also sued Tom and John Metzger, founders
of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, in 1990 after
skinhead followers of theirs from Portland, Ore., killed Mulugeta
Seraw, an Ethiopian student. A jury awarded the victim's family
$12.5 million.
