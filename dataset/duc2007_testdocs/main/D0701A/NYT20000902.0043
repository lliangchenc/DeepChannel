   The Good News About `Going Postal'
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14
co-workers, then himself. In the years since, there have been other
incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by
current or former postal workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New
York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going
postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.'' It was the
first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is linguistic history. Three-year-olds know what going
postal means.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Postal Service happy about this? Not at all. So, calmly,
it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _
with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that
your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an
Uzi out of his mail pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually
harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the
national workforce.'' Retail workers, it says, are eight times as
likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a serious one. ``The level of violence throughout
the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers
a variety of remedies. But it also seems intent on clearing the
Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is
that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second
only to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be rough. A new expression, once it has burst from
the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back. And ``going
Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A Restaurant That's All Lobby
</P>
<P>
   Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired
someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings
outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci
Gulch. Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and
the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other
Washington restaurant. Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest
investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father,
Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy,
a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the
Vatican), provided a simple explanation. So many closed doors, he
said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a
Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits
as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but
only 50 percent for a regular meal.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael
Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as
James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly. And if political
junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms
carefully, they might just be able to figure out the
behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the
lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one
of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that
fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether
to deploy a national missile defense system. He said he would not
do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes. The
president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided
not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed
to intercept incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic
solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the
United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S.
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temps, Unite  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers
because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often
receive inferior pay and benefits. But for years they were off
limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user
company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened.
The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such
unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's
permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Awards After an Uprising
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971
Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a
settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled. The awards,
which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal
battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died. Still,
the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of
lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of
Attica.''
</P>
<P>
   No Terminator, Please
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the
first robotic system that can design and build other robots with
almost no human help. The technique will merely speed up the
process of designing robots, said Dr. Jordan B. Pollack, a
professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the
researchers, and sharply drop the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Crime Continues to Decline
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its
lowest level since the government began its annual national crime
survey 26 years ago. Law enforcement officials credited
crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the
street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.
The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the
Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9
percent. But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and
property crimes committed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French and Corsica
</P>
<P>
   A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited
self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's
political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement
to resign in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive
constitutional issue in France. But the plan has also gained wide
backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen
moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have
thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Aryan Nations  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris
S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Dees, founder of
the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right
suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a
campaign to drive them out of business. The Aryan Nations compound
has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its
82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in
command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a
woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998. Dees'
goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to
surrender their compound in payment.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Influx in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at
the gambling table. The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las
Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any
state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent. Many of
those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were
Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.
California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population _
10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Eh, Get a Horse
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E.
Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly
installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford
vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. The judge said he intended to
issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles. Analysts estimated
the cost could run as high as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A New Trial for American
</P>
<P>
   After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President
Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can
get. That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial
to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret
before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for
terrorism. The case has been a thorn ever since in relations
between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained
wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.
</P>
<P>
   A Finding on Death Row  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.
Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr., who was sent to death row in
1980. His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to
investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal
magistrate later found. On Aug. 18, David Folsom, a U.S. District
judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first
reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a
sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.
