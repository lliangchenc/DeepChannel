<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Threatened by Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS

   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A lawyer who specializes in
bankrupting hate groups is going after the Aryan Nations, whose
compound in the Idaho woods has served as a clubhouse for some of
America's most violent racists.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of
the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son
who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist
group. The victims are suing the Aryan Nations and founder Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put them out of business, that's what we try to do,'' Dees
said when the lawsuit was filed last year. He has declined
additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the lawsuit was brought by enemies of the white
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is for the white man today,'' Butler, 82,
said Wednesday. ''I think it's a rape of the American justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has its origins on July 1, 1998, when Victoria Keenan,
43, and her son Jason, 20, were driving on a country road near
Hayden Lake. Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations'
20-acre compound.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a
gunshot, piled into a truck and chased the Keenans, who are part
white, part American Indian, for two miles. They fired five bullets
into the Keenan car and forced it off the road. Both Keenans were
punched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the guards were convicted of assault and are in prison. A
third remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans are alleging assault, false imprisonment and
emotional distress at the hands of the guards, who they contend
were agents of the Aryan Nations. They are seeking an unspecified
amount in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and his attorney Edgar Steele are expected to argue that
he should not be held liable for the actions of the volunteer
security guards. Steele did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Steele described the security guards as
''borderline derelicts'' who were not under Butler's control.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's beliefs should not be used against him, the defense
documents said, ''Demonizing Jews is still legal under the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups. In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building. In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland case is similar to the Keenan lawsuit, in that Dees
argued that White Aryan Resistance founders Tom and John Metzger
incited the skinheads to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Dees has received death threats in the past, so the Southern
Poverty Law Center will have its own security force to augment the
tight security promised by Kootenai County authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior. He presides over weekly services in a chapel where an
Israeli flag is used as a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his disciples have included some of the most
notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert
Mathews, Randy Weaver and Buford Furrow, a former security guard at
the Aryan Nations compound who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on
charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up
a Jewish day care center last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, however, has been largely able to escape jail time. In
1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a
plot to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the
white supremacist movement.
</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes. The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the possible loss of his home ''bothers me a little
bit.'' He is appealing for defense funds from neo-Nazi
sympathizers, writing on his Web site: ''We must not let the
enemies of our race win this round.''
</P>
<P>
   Six distributors of skinhead music are donating proceeds from
the sale of CDs with titles like ''Too White for You,'' and
''Holocaust 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bertollini, a wealthy former computer executive who
lives in nearby Sandpoint, Idaho, sent a mailing to thousands of
Idaho households last week attacking Dees as an ''anti-white, Jew
supremacist.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think about it,'' Bertollini's mailing said. ''A Jew team
of lawyers trying to destroy a white Christian church.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees is not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Aryan Nations are looking forward to seeing the
group punished.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wassmuth, whose Coeur d'Alene home was once bombed by white
supremacists, said it is important to hold leaders of hate groups
responsible for the actions of their followers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will a successful outcome eliminate hate groups in the
Northwest? No,'' Wassmuth said. ''Will it have an impact? Most
certainly.''
