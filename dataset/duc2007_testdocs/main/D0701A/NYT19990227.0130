   BRITAIN-RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder
of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the
spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of
Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution
in race relations. The report makes damning criticisms of the
metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first
time in Britain, institutional racism. It calls for widespread
reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed
problem in modern British society. The investigation was so marred
from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably
never be punished. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

after the fall of Suharto, and the prospects for the June general
election. Developing. (Albright-Kunstel, Atlanta

   DATELINE -CALCUTTA _ CALCUTTA _ The 21st century is drawing
near, but in Calcutta, the most vital mode of transportation is
still the rickshaw. Although most are now pulled by cycle,
manually-pulled ones are still prevalent in poorer and more
congested neighborhoods. The average rickshaw puller wakes at dawn
and pulls his buggy like a human beast of burden till sundown.

   BLACK-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON - At the end of the 20th century,
America's dilemma is still the same as it was when the century
dawned - the ``color line,'' in the famous words of W.E.B. Dubois.
But what of the next 100 years? If current trends continue, what
will be the standing of African Americans at the end of the 21st
century? Displaced by Hispanics as the largest ethnic group - and
voting bloc - will they have the political clout to make demands?
Or will there, in fact, be any reason for demands, assuming America
finally does become color blind? (Shepard, Cox News Service).

   BLACK-DATA _ The changing racial face of America; how teen and
adult attitudes toward race relations differ. MOVED TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-PLAYERS _ WASHINGTON _ The battle lines are forming in the
contest for the Republican Party's 2000 presidential election. Some
strategists, handlers, fund raisers and advertising executives are
choosing up sides, but some are content to watch as the two
front-runners, George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole, hold off on
formally becoming candidates. (Shepard, Cox News Service). MOVED
TUESDAY in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's complex
funding plan to save Social Security is an ineffective fraud,
Republicans charge. Democrats insist the plan will work, but
acknowledge that making it understandable to average voters is a
tough task. We take our shot. (Lipman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MOVED FRIDAY.

<P>
   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Can an 1890s anti-trust law be flexible
and youthful enough to govern a rapidly morphing technology
industry? We look at some of the possible scenarios coming out of
the Microsoft trial, including possible remedies, and whether any
of this can build a governmental framework around a changeling
industry. MOVED FRIDAY in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories. (Glass, Cox News Service). 30.

   GA-DELEG _ WASHINGTON _ Sam Nunn and Newt Gingrich looked out
for Georgia, and while the state's 13 members of Congress are every
bit as vigilant, they lack the clout of the onetime chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee and the Speaker of the House. The
Georgia delegation is scrambling on several fronts to minimize the
damage from Gingrich's resignation, which followed Nunn's
retirement by two years. The 106th Congress may not be as kind to
Georgia as its predecessors. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   JASPER-PRIEST _ JASPER, Texas _ The Rev. Ron Foshage was a
consoler in the courtroom all through the dreadful trial that
appalled America. The Catholic priest was a familiar sight at the
Jasper County courthouse because he volunteered to sit with the
ailing father of the white racist on trial for dragging a black man
to death. His role was one of the most difficult he's ever had to
face. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   HATEGROUPS _ MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor
Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy
Lumina could carry him. A section of sky glowed the orange of a
fireball. Three days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier
to the door of the Macedonia Baptist Church. A skull and crossbones
on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is
watching you.'' By the time he pulled up, what looked like a
tornado of fire churned from the middle of the church. Before
sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of 400 other black
churches burned from 1993 to 1996. So when a white lawyer from
Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in
the Macedonia flock were skeptical. Doubters figured Morris Dees
was out to make a buck on their tragedy. But since co-founding the
Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil
lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate
group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill. Now in
his legal firing line is the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist
group in Idaho. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Here's a great idea for gun manufacturers,
though they won't think so right away: Their industry should start
thinking about supporting national gun control. No, really.
(Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Any thought that the slightly larger
paychecks Congress approved for our military is going to get a
person to join is to miss the real point of why so many are
declining to remain: Someone could get killed out there. The U.S.
has become unbridled in its use of U.S. troops around the world.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ In ramping up for his coming
presidential race, Al Gore has sent a two-page letter more than
100,000 people, inviting them to become members of his ``National
Steering Committee'' _ a group that will never meet and has no
formal duties. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in
the Washington bureau.) MOVES THURSDAY.

   VULCAN _ BIRMINGHAM _ From the ground, he still looks like a
Roman god. Vulcan, billed as the world's largest cast-iron statue,
ripples with bronzed metallic muscles as he looms atop Red
Mountain. But if you climb his 123-foot pedestal and stand in the
pigeon poop around his sandaled feet, it's obvious that the man of
iron isn't in peak condition these days. His ankles are rusting.
Lime leaches down his calves. Water drips embarrassingly from his
crotch. ``Vulcan is like a lot of people you meet in bars,'' says
local deejay Guy ``Beaner'' Patton, ``better looking from a
distance.'' (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS
