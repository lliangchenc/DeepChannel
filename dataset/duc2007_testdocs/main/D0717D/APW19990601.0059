<HEADLINE> Another Fen-Phen Trial Under Way </HEADLINE>

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The family of a woman who died after taking the  
diet drug combination fen-phen is determined to get a verdict in a 
trial involving the drug's maker, an attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in talking settlement,'' said Tommy  
Fibich, one of two lawyers for the family of Mary Marisa Smith, a 
34-year-old mother of two who died while trying to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit by Ms. Smith's family is believed to be the first  
relating to the death of a fen-phen user to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit asserts that American Home Products Corp.  
underreported the instances of pulmonary hypertension as a result 
of using fenfluramine, the ``fen'' part of the drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The company in the past has contended that evidence linking the  
drug to the disease is inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fibich said Ms. Smith died of infection in late 1997 while  
waiting for a heart-lung transplant. She spent her final days 
hooked to a catheter delivering drugs directly to her lungs to keep 
blood vessels flowing, Fibich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments took place Tuesday, with testimony to begin  
Wednesday. Fibich estimated the trial will take about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products settled another Texas case halfway into a  
trial earlier this year. The plaintiff, Sandra Moore of Johnson 
County, claimed that fenfluramine caused her heart valve damage. 
The defense had yet to begin presenting its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Texas woman took American Home Products to court last  
month in Canton, but the trial was delayed because lawyers said 
they could not seat an impartial jury. Debbie Stone Lovett also 
alleged fenfluramine caused heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled  
fenfluramine from the market, citing evidence it may have 
irreversibly -- and sometimes fatally -- scarred users' heart valves. 
An estimated 6.6 million people have used the diet drug 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products is the nation's  
seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. Through Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, the company marketed Pondimin, (the brand name for 
fenfluramine) and Redux, a similar product.
