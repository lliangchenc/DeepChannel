<HEADLINE> Report: Co. To Pay in Fen-Phen Case  </HEADLINE>

    HOUSTON (AP) -- American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9
million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for
any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston
Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal was reached Friday, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
source. Attorneys and the company both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Brinkley, 55, had to have two heart valves replaced with artificial
valves and was facing a third replacement, allegedly because of side effects
from the drugs. Her case was to go to trial on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   John O'Quinn, her attorney, said Brinkley began taking fen-phen in 1995 to
lose weight and treat an acid reflux problem. Her heart valve problems were
diagnosed a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home made the "fen" in fen-phen, a drug called fenfluramine. It
sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical cousin called
Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo
Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Phentermine hasn't been linked to problems when taken alone. It is made by
another company and is still on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would
pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits. However, attorneys representing
thousands of fen-phen users said they won't participate in the settlement.
