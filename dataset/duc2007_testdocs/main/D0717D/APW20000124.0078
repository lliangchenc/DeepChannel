<HEADLINE> American Home Sued for Concealment  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   NEW YORK -- American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits
related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing
partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of
the pills.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against
American Home in the suit filed in the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately
concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine)
and phentermine.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of
Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by AHP.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997
through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly
moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to
its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to
the suit. Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt
when the drugs were banned, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious
financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of
millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual
obligations with Interneuron. A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all
safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997. Pondimin was
made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many
clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble
completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert is now in
talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with
American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen
as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart
valve damage after taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home
should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the
information.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the
results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24
cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve
disease. In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Interneuron fell 50 cents to $3 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares
of American Home fell $5 to $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.
