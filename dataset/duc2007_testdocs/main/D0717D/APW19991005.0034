<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Settlement Expected in NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A judge dismissed the jury in a  
class-action lawsuit against one of the makers of the fen-phen diet 
drug combination, raising expections of a possible out-of-court 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In sending jurors home Monday, Superior Court Judge Marina  
Corodemus said she would hear the case without a jury starting Oct. 
12 if a settlement is not reached before then, plaintiffs' attorney 
Steven Sheller said. The jury had been hearing testimony 
intermittently since Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheller said he thought the case would be settled. Officials  
with American Home Products, the drug company, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The case pits the Madison-based company against about 94,000 New  
Jersey residents who used the diet pill combination, which was 
taken off the market two years ago after being linked to serious 
heart and lung damage in users. American Home Products sold the 
``fen'' half of the combination under the brand name Pondimin, and 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs did not develop heart or lung damage, but the  
want American Home Products to cover the cost of future medical 
checkups in case problems develop down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it for weight loss in 
combination with another drug, phentermine. The combination became 
known as fen-phen. When taken alone, phentermine never was 
associated with health problems and it remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,100 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal  
courts against American Home Products over fenfluramine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has proposed a national settlement in which it would  
pay $1.2 billion for future medical examinations for healthy users 
of the drug, and an additional $2.8 billion to settle individual 
suits from people who claim the drug has harmed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorneys claim the company hid information from  
doctors, patients and regulators about possible links to heart 
valve disease and an often fatal lung condition called primary 
pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The company denies hiding information, and says it acted  
properly in marketing the drugs.
