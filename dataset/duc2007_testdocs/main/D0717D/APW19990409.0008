<HEADLINE> Drug Maker Settles Fen-Phen Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The first trial over heart-valve damage from  
fen-phen has ended in a reported $500,000 settlement for a woman 
who used the diet drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came a week into Sandra Moore's case against the  
pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp. The 52-year-old 
former teacher had sought $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said today it had agreed to a settlement but  
offered no details. The Dallas Morning News, citing unidentified 
sources, reported that the company will pay $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found mild heart valve damage in Ms. Moore after she  
took fen-phen to promote weight loss, and she is on medication for 
her condition. She claimed American Home knew heart problems could 
result but hid them to maximize profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Michael McGartland, did not return calls seeking  
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home argued that Ms. Moore has a mild and common  
disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary. The 
company said it acted responsibly in marketing and monitoring its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary,  
marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- and 
Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux  
off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request. A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug maker has since been hit with hundreds of lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore's lawsuit, the first of its kind to go to a jury, was  
being closely followed by others with similar claims against the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lawyer Kip Petroff, who has 100 fen-cases, said the  
settlement could encourage more lawsuits, even from people who 
didn't suffer major medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a mild case is worth however much they got, I think there  
are lawyers who are going to be encouraged to pursue such cases,'' 
Petroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Keith, a Fort Worth lawyer who said he has rejected  
several fen-phen cases, said he disagreed because such cases are 
expensive to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``To sue for $110 million and then a week later take half a  
million dollars is not what I call a victory; I call that a loss,'' 
he said. ``I believe it'll have a chilling effect on people with 
minor to modest damages.''
