<HEADLINE> American Home Products settles Fen-Phen lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - American Home Products settled a lawsuit with
the family of a Quincy woman who died after taking the fen-phen drug combination
in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding, the company announced Thursday.
<P>
	   Terms of the deal with relatives of Mary J. Linnen were not released, but
the Madison, N.J.-based company said much of the settlement will be used to fund
a medical research foundation established by the Linnen family.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the
"fen" drugs fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were combined with
phentermine to make "fen-phen."
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' lawsuit against phentermine-maker Fisons Corp. of Collegeville,
Pa., was dropped earlier this month after a judge ruled a medical witness'
conclusions were too speculative.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' wrongful death case was the first filed against American Home
Products in connection with the fen-phen drugs, said their lawyer, Alex
MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost six million Americans took the diet drug combination until it was
banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users
developed serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement by the company did not address the issue of whether or not
American Home Products admitted any wrongdoing, and Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus
refused to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But in their lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court, Linnen's parents, Thomas
F. and Mary J. Linnen, of Palm Coast, Fla., claimed that an autopsy at
Massachusetts General Hospital determined their daughter died as a result of
"pulmonary hypertension associated with fenfluramine and phentermine therapy for
endogenous obesity."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart valve
problems. It did not cover Linnen, who suffered primary pulmonary hypertension,
said Alex Zisson, an industry analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with
other claims that might arise. Even though the exact terms of the Linnen
settlement weren't known, Zisson said Wall Street had been given no reason to
believe it jeopardized that reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "They haven't given out a dollar figure, but at this point they've said the
charge will be adequate," Zisson said. "Wall Street at this point just wants all
the fen-phen litigation to go away. Even if American Home has to pay a little
more than the cases deserve, Wall Street would say that's a good deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Even at the time fen-phen was being marketed, primary pulmonary hypertension
was a recognized, although rare, side effect, Zisson said. The Linnens claimed
their daughter wasn't notified of the risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens and American Home Products settled the lawsuit after it went to
trial. The family claimed Mary Linnen developed PPH after taking fen-phen for 11
days in 1996, although the company disputed at trial that its drug could be
conclusively linked to her condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Linnen died in February 1997. The settlement also covered her doctor,
Abby Landzberg, of Newton.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Linnens' case was the first wrongful death lawsuit filed in
connection with fen-phen, it was not the first settled. In Houston last year,
relatives of 35-year-old Mary Marisa Smith, who claimed fen-phen killed her,
agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money three weeks into trial.
