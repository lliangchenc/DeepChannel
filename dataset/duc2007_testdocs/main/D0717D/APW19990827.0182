	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Shares of American Home Products Corp. fell  
sharply on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge that could 
allow patients in up to 44 states to collectively sue the company 
for the cost of monitoring their health after they took two diet 
drugs, known as fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home shares fell $3.87 1/2, or 8 percent, to $42.12 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The ruling late Thursday by 
U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia conditionally 
certified a class-action lawsuit against the company by patients 
who took the drugs Pondimin and Redux before they were withdrawn 
from the market in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision allows the federal suit filed last year to proceed  
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondimin and Redux, two prescription diet drugs often taken in  
combination, were taken off the market in 1997 at the request of 
the Food and Drug Administration after some users developed 
heart-valve damage. The combination was popularly known as 
``fen-phen,'' a reference to the first syllables of the chemicals 
used to make the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people took the drugs, though AHP  
contends the majority used them for less than 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide have been filed against the  
company by people who say they suffer heart and lung problems 
because of the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home denies any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia class-action seeks to have AHP pay for checkups  
for people who used the drugs for 30 days or more between 1992 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in six other states are excluded from the  
Philadelphia-based suit because similar suits are pending in those 
states, Bechtle ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes just as AHP has agreed to pay more than 36,000  
women to settle claims that the implantable contraceptive device 
Norplant caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP, the parent of Norplant maker Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, did  
not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement, saying Thursday it was 
``purely a business decision.''
