<HEADLINE> Judge hears final summations on fen-phen settlement proposal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Opponents of the proposed $3.75 billion fen-phen
settlement vowed Thursday to appeal if the deal is not rejected by
a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Edward F. Blizzard, who represents a group of users who
object to the settlement, made one final plea to U.S. District
Court Judge Louis C. Bechtle to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we allow this to go forward, there will be a substantial
risk it will be reversed and we will have wasted time'' that could
have been better spent attending to users' health needs, Blizzard
said during his final summation.
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Blizzard promised he would appeal to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals if Bechtle gives his approval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home
Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet
drug combination. The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the
combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a
chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The
second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, fen-phen users would get a maximum of $1.5
million, though most would get far less, depending on their level
of injury and how long they took the drugs. The settlement also
includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtle gave preliminary approval to the deal last November and
is expected to decide sometime this summer whether it will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say monetary damages are insufficient, the settlement
does not include compensation for people who may develop health
problems later and users had inadequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not yet fully understand the health effects of
fen-phen, Blizzard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, the headlights might not be able to capture
what is out there. The science has not been completed yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for American Home and plaintiffs' counsel disputed
that, pointing out that 16 major studies were performed to
determine the effects of Pondimin and Redux. The studies found that
any ill effects of the drug generally show up right away, said
plaintiffs' attorney Michael D. Fishbein.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, about 45,000 have refused the settlement and retain the
right to sue for punitive damages. Another 266,000 have registered
to join the class. Those people may still reject the settlement and
sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an overwhelming vote for approval of the terms
of the settlement,'' Fishbein said.
