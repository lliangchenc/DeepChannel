<HEADLINE> Judge approves $3.75 billion fen-phen settlement  </HEADLINE>

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal judge has approved the proposed
$3.75 billion national settlement of health claims stemming from
the diet drug combination fen-phen, which has been linked to
potentially fatal heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement approved Monday, fen-phen users would get
up to $1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on
their level of injury and how long they took the drugs. The
settlement also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle gave preliminary approval
to the deal last November.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home
Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet
drug combination. The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the
combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a
chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The
second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement resolves the vast majority of the claims and
potential claims that the company was facing and it's a very, very
significant step forward in resolving the litigation,'' said
Michael Scott of Philadelphia, one of the attorneys representing
American Home.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Edward F. Blizzard of Houston objected to the
settlement in June on behalf of a group of diet-drug users, saying
it would likely be reversed because of all the other lawsuits
pending. Blizzard, who did not immediately return a call for
comment Monday, had promised to appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals if the judge gives his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents say monetary damages are deficient, the
settlement does not include compensation for people who may develop
health problems later and users had inadequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, about 45,000 have refused the settlement and retain the
right to sue for punitive damages. Another 266,000 have registered
to join the class. Those people may still reject the settlement and
sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting
punitive damages.
