   HOUSTON _ The nation's first fen-phen wrongful death trial ended
in Harris County state district court Tuesday with a reported
settlement of $6 million to $7 million, and most jurors said
afterward they would not have awarded the plaintiffs any money at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we did the best we could for the kids,'' said Sandra
Stom of Friendswood, Texas, whose daughter Mary Marisa Smith, 35,
died in September 1997 of complications from a rare lung disease,
allegedly caused by the ``fen'' part of the diet drug combination.
</P>
<P>
   Stom was referring to Smith's children, 9 and 4 years old. Other
plaintiffs were Smith's husband, Michael, and father, Michael Stom.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys involved would not discuss the settlement, which is
supposed to be confidential. Lawyers said two other Harris County
fen-phen cases, which did not involve deaths, also settled for
confidential amounts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source who asked to remain anonymous said the Smith settlement
was between $6 million and $7 million, and the three settlements
were $7.5 million to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith case was closely watched because it could shed light
on whether juries will blame American Home Products of Madison,
N.J., for contributing to the death or injury of fen-phen patients.
About 6 million people took one form of the two types of fen drugs
the company sold. The company said in March that more than 2,600
suits had been filed nationwide. More than 600 have been filed so
far in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   American Home is accused of deliberately downplaying the risks
of the two fen drugs, both of which were removed from the market in
September 1997 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after they
were linked to heart valve problems, a condition Smith did not
have.
</P>
<P>
   Company lawyers said they felt vindicated by a poll the 12
jurors and one alternate took privately after being excused by
state District Judge Katie Kennedy. Several jurors said that there
were eight votes for American Home, three for the plaintiffs and
two undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scientist, and I was leaning for the defense because of
the science,'' said juror Dave Sawicki of Houston, 47, who works in
oil and gas. ``There were a lot of emotional adjectives and adverbs
during the trial, but I kept looking at the risk of the disease,
and it was rare. I didn't feel there were any good guys or bad
guys, it was just a tragic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror Gaetne Pauwels, who cried during testimony describing
Smith's death and the children's suffering, said she felt ``exactly
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence showing the company was negligent was flagrant,''
said Pauwels. ``I'm the same age as Mrs. Smith was and I have two
children about the same age, so I could relate to what they would
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Paul Stallings said he found the straw vote
``interesting'' because the defense was only into its second day
and the plaintiffs had two weeks to present their evidence. He said
the straw vote will have no bearing on what the company does in
other cases. Plaintiffs' attorney Graham Hill said he was surprised
by the straw vote. He said the outcome would have been different
after jurors deliberated.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that before the settlement was reached, Kennedy had
allowed into evidence a memo written by a top FDA official saying
the company had manipulated the agency, reversing her prior ruling
keeping it out.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, he said, also allowed evidence that the company
threatened to sue a pharmacy that tried to warn customers about the
drug's possible risks with a boxed warning on its pharmacy
envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   A top American Home official testified Monday that the risks of
the fen drug that Smith took outweighed the benefits if taken
longer than three months. Smith took it for year.
</P>
<P>
   No jury has yet deliberated on a fen-phen case, and the Smith
case was the furthest any such case has progressed. The first case
to go to trial did not involve anyone's death and was settled for a
reported $500,000 on April 8 in Cleburne.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers have said that American Home wants to avoid
a jury decision while it is trying to negotiate a settlement of all
fen-phen litigation. The company has refused to discuss those
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who weighed about 270 pounds, took the drug fenfluramine,
brand named Pondimin, and phentermine for about a year and lost 70
pounds. Her prescribing doctor, Leo Borrell, was also sued, but he
was dismissed by the plaintiffs last week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith died of a blood infection caused by a catheter used to
pump in a drug to widen her pulmonary blood vessels, which the suit
said had become constricted by Pondimin.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that about 5 percent of the
fen-phen cases involve similar constrictions, called primary
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fen-phen cases allege heart-valve leakage problems,
while others claim ``neurotoxicity,'' which has various symptoms,
such as fatigue and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 European study said long-term users of prescription diet
drugs had a 23-fold greater risk than the general public of
incurring primary pulmonary hypertension. But even for long-term
diet drug users, the annual risk was low, estimated to be 23 to 46
per million users, and there is no widely accepted biological
mechanism linking the drugs to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin
and Redux, or dexfenfluramine.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorneys claimed that for much of the early 1990s,
American Home Products greatly underreported the associations of
Pondimin with primary pulmonary hypertension to get FDA approval of
Redux in 1996. Until 1997, Pondimin's label said the drug had been
associated with four cases of the disease and one death. Company
officials testified that they were aware of at least five
associations as of 1991 and 62 associations and 11 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, company officials conceded the label was
inaccurate, but said the FDA knew about all the reported
associations and had never demanded it be changed. They said part
of the reason they did not change it was that they were awaiting
the results of the European study.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also tried to show the company sought to
avoid the most serious type of warning label, bordered by black
boxes, because it would drastically cut sales.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the boldfaced warning that was used was
adequate and approved by the FDA, which had determined that the
drugs' benefits outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, the phen part of the combo, was never associated
with the same risks and is still available.
