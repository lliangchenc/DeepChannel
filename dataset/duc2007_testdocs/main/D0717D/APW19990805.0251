<HEADLINE> Drug Suit Seeks Checkups, Millions </HEADLINE>

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Healthy but still worried, thousands of  
people who took the fen-phen diet drug combination are seeking 
millions to pay for years of medical checkups in case they develop 
heart or lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence linking the ``fen'' half of the drug duo with sometimes  
deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against  
American Home Products, which made fenfluramine. If American Home 
loses the civil trial, it could be forced to pay more than $1 
billion over the next decade, one economist estimated in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications are huge,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry  
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. ``You're talking about as 
much as $1,000 per year per patient. Then if you take the national 
implications ... you're looking at some serious problems for the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit by New Jersey residents is the first class-action case  
against American Home to come to trial and the only one seeking 
payment for medical checkups rather than financial awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home already has settled several of  
about 3,100 individual suits, but those settlements are estimated 
to total only around $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton, Texas,  
on Wednesday, attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home 
hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett, a 36-year-old manicurist, said she developed leaky heart  
valves after taking fenfluramine. She is seeking unspecified 
damages in the case, now before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine,  
which was sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical 
look-alike, dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home pulled both drugs off pharmacy shelves in  
September 1997, several months after the first reports from the 
Mayo Clinic linking the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve 
damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The company insists there's no scientific proof that patients  
who stopped taking the drugs about two years ago and have no 
disease now will be injured in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that routine echocardiograms are not  
medically warranted for patients who have taken these drugs,'' said 
company lawyer Anita Hotchkiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies since the drugs were recalled generally indicate a  
slightly elevated risk of valve disorders, but that it appears to 
fade after patients stop taking them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
