NAPSTER KICKS OFF 300,000 METALLICA FANS  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle

<P>
   Embattled software startup Napster Inc. said Wednesday that it
has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock
group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the
San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a
formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.
Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as
long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the formal online reinstatement request form asks the
banned members to give ``your consent to be sued by Metallica in
the federal court where you reside.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press release titled ```Heavy Metal Heavyweights K.O.
Fans,'' Napster attorney Laurence F. Pulgram said the company ``has
taken extraordinary steps to comply with Metallica's demands to
block hundreds of thousands of its fans from using the Napster
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica attorney Howard K. King said the band still had no
intention of suing individual fans and that it was ``outrageous''
Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has done is let Napster fly its true colors,'' King
said. ``They don't have any intention of protecting copyrighted
material.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass takedown of Napster users is the latest twist in the
short but controversial history of the startup, which makes a
popular software program that allows users to freely share and
trade downloadable music compressed into the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica filed a $10 million civil suit against the company on
April 13 for copyright infringement and racketeering. Napster is
also fighting similar suits by rap artist Dr. Dre and the Recording
Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich hand-delivered 13
cardboard boxes filled with the screen names of more than 335,000
Napster users the band said claims  &LR; were offering illegal copies of
Metallica songs during the last weekend of April. The band demanded
Napster terminate access for those users.
</P>
<P>
   The event became a media circus outside Napster's downtown San
Mateo offices. The next day, without fanfare, Metallica's lawyers
transmitted an electronic version of the list to Napster. The list
was culled to 317,377 when Metallica agreed not to go after Napster
fans who had copies of bootleg music that were authorized by the
band.
</P>
<P>
   Napster began blocking members on Metallica's list last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock last night when I saw I was blocked,'' said Jay
Arnold of Tulsa, Okla., who added that he also felt ``betrayed by
Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he has purchased CDs after hearing songs he sampled
using Napster. But now, he won't buy the latest ``Mission
Impossible'' soundtrack because it contains a Metallica song.
``They want to have this image of being rock and roll rebels and
they do crap like this,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Banned Napster users seeking reinstatement have to sign an
online form requiring their real names, addresses and a sworn
statement they believe they were mistakenly blocked. Napster will
forward the forms to Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   A Napster spokesman did not know how many users had filed forms
but said it was running into the ``thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet message boards were filled with posts from banned users
who got back online simply by deleting Napster and any references
to Metallica on their hard drives. They then reinstalled Napster
and signed on using another name.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newest version of Napster keeps track of anyone who
has been banned in the past, Napster users said they simply
reinstalled older Napster versions that didn't have that function.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Napster controversy has made a team of Santa
Clara University students $1,000 richer.
</P>
<P>
   The four sophomore business majors, Kelly Walsh, Laura Erickson,
Joseph Rushmer and Blaze Smallwood, recently won first place in a
nationwide business ethics competition by suggesting a compromise
to the recording industry's beefs with Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The solution called for the Recording Industry Association of
America to drop its civil suit against Napster in exchange for a
cooperative agreement with the software company that included
Napster supplying demographic data on its users to the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Ethics and Business at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles awarded first prize to the Santa Clara
students.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the students picked the Napster issue because it is
particularly popular among college students, so popular that the
program has been banned or restricted on about 100 campuses because
of bandwidth or copyright problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Napster Web site could actually facilitate the sale of
merchandise or concert tickets,'' she said. ``There's so much more
than record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the proliferation of Napster-style file-sharing
software, the team sought to devise an all-encompassing solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge issue,'' Walsh said. ``I might not go to Tower
Records to steal a CD, but don't have a problem downloading an MP3
into my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster suffered a legal setback in its case with the RIAA when
a judge ruled it has not proven the company is protected by one
provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
