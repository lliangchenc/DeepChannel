METALLICA TO TRY TO PREVENT FANS FROM DOWNLOADING RECORDINGS 
</HEADLINE>

   The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has
brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which
say copyrighted songs are being pirated. Wednesday the dispute is
expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians
directly against their fans.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans
from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over
the Internet. A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by
their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available
for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be
obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using
the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users
from reregistering.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively
popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and
already faces several lawsuits. The Metallica lawyer said that if
the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other
musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of
users.
</P>
<P>
   And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the
dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the
most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting
the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with
dogged loyalty. ``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if
they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site
catering to heavy-metal fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer,
Howard King. He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create
and market an album and did not want to have the music traded
freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica
to be at odds with its fans. But he said that Napster has put
Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand.''
That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a
log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have
Metallica music to offer.
</P>
<P>
   King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster,
which is based in San Mateo, Calif., in a collection of documents
filling 30 cardboard boxes. His plans were reported Tuesday by
Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users who download the Napster software can then use
the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers. By so
doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in
effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen
to or download music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy
because the music is not kept on the company's computers. Further,
they say their users must comply with copyright law. Elizabeth
Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company
would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of
copyright.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company was obliged to take the step under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an
online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned
that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of
Napster's ``several million'' users. She declined to say how much
music is available for trading through the service.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued
Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged
primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording
Industry Association of America. On another front in the digital
music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last
week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database,
MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band
decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the
dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies,
but about the bands themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the RIAA sued, they did it in a legalistic manner
that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said. ``We though this
would bring the issue out more if we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be
particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the
early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til
Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to
bootleg. It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes
in rock.
</P>
<P>
   Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free
then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its
current CDs. It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing
the bands money by sharing music online. Rather, he said, those who
have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or
made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the
practice to a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   He said Metallica had lost touch with its fans. ``They're the
No. 1 fan of George Washington,'' he said, referring to the the $1
bill. ``They're just being the man,'' he said.
