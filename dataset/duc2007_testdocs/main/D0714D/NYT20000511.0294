   The US Constitution gives Congress the power to establish
copyright protections ``to promote the progress of science and the
useful arts.'' This principle is as valid today as when the
Constitution was written in 1787. Congress and the courts need to
adapt it to the Internet, which offers access to an extraordinary
amount of information even as it provides opportunity to limit what
people see, hear, and read.
</P>
<P>
   Intense legal battles are being waged today over the use of MP3
technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in
a compressed form. Computer-users are able to amass collections of
hundreds of songs on their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry might have embraced this technology as a
new, more convenient way of getting music to its customers, but it
has been slow to allow the release of material by well-known
performers. Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and
Napster, have stepped into this vacuum. The Recording Industry
Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and
has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular
material.
</P>
<P>
   The association has a point about Napster. This program,
available at no cost on the Internet, allows anyone who signs up to
share MP3 files with any other Napster members. Thursday afternoon,
5,423 Napsterites were on line with 621,881 songs (many of them
duplicates). Some of the music came from aspiring artists eager to
be heard, but most was by famous acts, who would much rather have
fans buy their compact discs so they could collect royalties.
Needless to say, most famous performers have not given Napster or
Napster members permission to run a song-sharing service.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com had a better idea. It wanted to create a database of
80,000 popular CDs and allow access only to people who could prove
electronically that they owned, or at least had physical possession
of, the actual CD. The Napster case is pending, but Judge Jed S.
Rakoff in New York federal court ruled last month that the MP3.com
plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections.
Both companies have since taken steps to reduce their legal
exposure, but the larger issues remain.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of CDs are not without rights. Under the legal doctrine
of ``fair use,'' first promulgated in 1840 and upheld repeatedly
since then, people can make many uses of copyright material: using
a portion in a book review, sampling a bit of a song for a musical
parody, and making a recording for their own, noncommercial use.
</P>
<P>
   This week heavy metal group Metallica forced Napster to ban
317,377 users from the service on the ground they had illegally
copied Metallica songs. But suppose someone owned the entire
Metallica CD and just wanted to use Napster to make MP3 copies of a
few tunes? That ought to be considered ``fair use,'' and the
MP3.com approach would have allowed this copying.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recording industry wins all its battles in court,
new programs are being developed to allow the sharing of MP3 files.
Gnutella and other programs eliminate the key legal vulnerability
of Napster _ its dependence on central computers to facilitate
file-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is pinning its hopes for protecting its
wares on encryption. The Sony Corp., which pioneered the Walkman
technology that revolutionized music listening, has devised the
Music Clip, a new kind of portable music player that forces users
to convert MP3 files into a coded format. When Sony invented the
Walkman, which played unencrypted tape cassettes, it had not yet
bought the CBS recording company.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption denies the buyer an opportunity to move the music
into different formats, to combine selected cuts off CDs or to use
bits for parody or other legal purposes. It would seem to violate
the ``fair use'' doctrine. Congress and the courts need to refine
copyright protection in a way that benefits consumers as well as
giant industries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, major record companies ought to go beyond legal
stratagems to define a marketing program that fully utilizes the
MP3 format. The songs of Metallica and other famous artists ought
to be available for a small fee, and the work of those popular acts
ought to be featured on the same site as those of emerging artists,
as MP3.com had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The great promise of Internet technology is that it will make
``science and the useful arts'' widely available at the touch of a
computer mouse. The recording industry should not let Draconian
interpretations of the copyright laws inhibit the growth of this
powerful medium.
