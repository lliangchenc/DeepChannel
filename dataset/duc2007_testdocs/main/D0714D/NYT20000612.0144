   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ Unable to party, unable to date, unable to
do much of anything but work and then work out in the wee hours,
Shawn Fanning contemplated the pickup line for a full five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, ya think?'' he asked, blushing although no girls were in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   He considered the line some more. The blush deepened. Suddenly
seeming all of 19, which he is, the confidence that led Fanning to
take on the entire music industry crumpled along with the square of
paper in his hand on which the line was written.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's funny, but I would never say it because
everything is Napster right now,'' Fanning said. ``I can't go back
home or go out without hearing about it. It's neat but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, maybe I would use it,'' he relented at last. ``But I have
a pretty shy personality. I don't know. It's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanning may have trouble invoking his middle-school nickname to
his advantage, but it's on the lips of teenagers, college students,
and record industry executives everywhere. Napster is what Fanning
dubbed the music file-sharing software he developed in his first
semester at Northeastern University. He never had a second.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he opted to become that high-tech hybrid: not quite
man, not quite boy, out to make his mark and his millions before he
is old enough to drink legally at one of the raves he wishes he had
time to attend. So far, despite $15 million in venture-capital
funding, what he's earned mostly is adulation and notoriety in the
combative arena of online music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Napster _ the computer application, not the admittedly lousy
guitarist _ makes it easy to copy music files stored on the hard
drives of other users. More than 10 million people have signed up
for it since its launched last August. Just type in the name of
just about any song and there it is, available for downloading in
the digital-file format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the most popular of the music-swapping services is
free. No money changes hands, not between user and Napster Inc.,
and not between the site and the major record labels that are
panicked about a distribution system they didn't see coming and are
suing to stop. On Friday, the labels appeared to be coming to terms
with online music, with two companies settling their lawsuits
against digital music service MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning hasn't profited yet, either. He figures he'd likely earn
more, at least in the short term, as a programmer at any
established computer company. Nights _ well past midnight, actually
_ he returns to the spartan $1,800-a-month, two-bedroom apartment
he shares with Napster cofounder Sean Parker, 20; three other
programmers crash on the floor. Fanning said he has no plans to
live large, not yet. His one indulgence was a second, souped-up
Mazda, and that feels so extravagant he may sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gave me $15 million personally,'' Fanning said. ``I try
not to even think about it. Things are so volatile right now, so
many things going on, so many fires to fight every day, not just
technically but in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   He was alluding to Napster Inc.'s battle to be the middleman
between music fans and music makers, a subject his team of
attorneys has warned him to keep quiet about in the midst of all
the lawsuits. Some bands, such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Hole,
say the Napster program is democratizing the music business and are
cheering Fanning on. Others, such as rapper Dr. Dre and the
heavy-metal rockers Metallica, liken what it does to piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was dramatized to great effect last month, when
a van pulled up to the bland building Napster occupies in downtown
San Mateo and dumped a dozen or so boxes of paperwork on the
doorstep. Inside: the names of 300,000 people the band Metallica
wanted booted from the service for copyright infringement.
Upstairs, Fanning was dismayed at the ultimatum, even as he longed
to meet Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, one of his musical heroes.
Still, he complied immediately. Almost as fast, many users figured
out how to get back on the server. For its part, Napster says it's
not responsible if people use its service to steal music and
violate copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Shawn Fanning, but he seems to be a pretty good
kid who came up with a sensational program,'' said Howard King, the
Los Angeles lawyer suing Napster on behalf of Metallica and Dr.
Dre. ``But the sensational program has allowed people to take music
without paying. . . . Shawn probably had no idea of the legal
ramifications of what he created. I'm sure the thought never
crossed his mind.''

<P>
   Bored at Northeastern
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Back in his dorm room at Northeastern, Fanning was bored. He'd
barely been online for three years, but already he considered the
introductory computer science classes he was taking beneath his
skill level.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it, ``I was partying all the time. I was having a lot
of fun. But I wasn't really learning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the self-taught programmer had already had several
computer-related jobs, helping a company develop software, starting
a computer-security service he described as ``kind of a joke,''
interning summers at his uncle's Internet games company. The latter
job earned him a dark blue BMW Z3 as partial payment for his
services _ his first car and one that both elated and embarrassed a
boy who had never had any extras.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning grew up in Brockton, Mass and assorted Cape Cod towns
before settling in HarwichPort, the son of a nurse's aide who got
pregnant when she was younger than he is now and the stepson of a
truck driver. His biological father came from a wealthy
Massachusetts family, and the two have recently established a
relationship that Fanning would prefer to keep private.
</P>
<P>
   His own family, including four younger stepbrothers and
stepsisters, spent time on welfare, a subject that still makes
Fanning visibly uncomfortable. So do the months he spent in a
foster home when his parents had no money and lost their home.
Despite the expectations others have of him, and that he has for
himself, Fanning still tastes the sting of where he came from more
than the sweetness of where he might be headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Shawn had to go into a foster home, I told him that I had
talked to my wife and we only had a small apartment, but he could
come live with us,'' said his uncle, John Fanning. ``He was just a
kid, 12 or 13, but he said, `I guess I've always known that was an
option for me, but to tell you the truth there's no way I can leave
my brothers or sisters.' Right then, it showed you the sort of
responsibility he feels. I think a lot of his drive comes from
wanting to be someone who can improve the conditions for his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But what drove him to dream up Napster in the fall of 1998 _
with the help of his uncle's advice and later his seed money _ was
more immediate. His roommate was into downloading digital music and
was constantly complaining about the inconsistent quality and the
inadequacy of the search engines available. Fanning decided he was
the teenager to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   So he bought a Windows programming book, and went to work,
seeking feedback on Internet Relay Chat, an online hangout popular
with computerphiles of all ages. That's where he met Parker and
Jordan Ritter, who worked for a Boston security firm before
becoming another Napster cofounder.
</P>
<P>
   For the self-described obsessive personality, classes soon took
a back seat to building what would become Napster, a nickname that
childhood friends said the closely cropped Fanning earned one day
on the basketball court when another player commented on his sweaty
head. As news of the Napster application spread by word of mouth _
and across the Net _ it quickly became the hot program on college
campuses nationwide.
