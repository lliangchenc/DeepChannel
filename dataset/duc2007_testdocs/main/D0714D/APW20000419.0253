   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The heavy metal band Metallica on
Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the
school agreed to block access from their computer network to an
Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after
Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other
universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular
Internet music sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Wednesday, the band said it would drop
Yale as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the prompt and responsible reaction by Yale
University in dealing with the gross violations of copyright laws
and the protection of intellectual property,'' the band said in a
written statement. ''We thank them for their quick response to the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said that some months ago Yale blocked
access to the Napster Web site during business hours in an effort
to relieve congestion on the school's network. In February, the
school ''alerted'' students to federal copyright laws as they
applied to Napster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, at the time of the lawsuit, we notified students that we
were blocking access to Napster continuously, until we could
clarify the legal issues surrounding Napster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for
and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, Metallica alleged Yale, the University of
Southern California and Indiana University allowed free trade of
copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the
Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The band filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
on April 13.
