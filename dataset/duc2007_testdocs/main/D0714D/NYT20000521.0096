REPORT PROPOSES UPDATE OF COPYRIGHT ACT 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on
the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says
in a report to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes outlawing technologies like the
controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade
music files with little regard to copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the
Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief,
``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business
Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels
and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and
downloadable music to gain market share. Scheduled witnesses
include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal
proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3. At
Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known
artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its
report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed
updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright
protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of
Internet access services and search services from liability when
their users transmit pirated works.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online
service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits
from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the
rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious
copyright infringement. The groups are seeking damages that could
add up to billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software works like a co-op. It enables users to swap
songs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression
formula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files. Record
companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables
distribution of music without any copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the
law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted
that way,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, director of the institute and
a co-author of the report. ``So we just say, let's tighten the
law.'' ``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service
provider.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended
``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for
copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability
for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes that services like Napster be required to
collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users,
such as addresses and credit-card information. And it recommends
that the services be required to remove infringing users within a
specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its
users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because
it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in
trading copyrighted music. Recently, however, Napster did bar
300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the
fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the
recommendations in his report. But he said he hoped that
Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the
need to update the digital copyright law to address new
technologies.

<P>
   Any such proposals would likely be met with resistance from the
civil libertarian community, which opposed the original law as
potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you are going to take a whole new category of software
and strangle it in its infancy because one of its first uses
resulted in piracy _ that's a bad idea,'' said John Gilmore,
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online
liberties group based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and
Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise
that was passed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could open a Pandora's box,'' said Peter Harter, a lobbyist
for a company called eMusic, who worked for Netscape when the
digital copyright law was passed. Harter is among the witnesses
scheduled to testify Wednesday.
