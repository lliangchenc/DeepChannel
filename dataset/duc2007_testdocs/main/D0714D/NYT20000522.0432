 NAPSTER NAMES CEO, SECURES NEW FINANCING  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster Inc. appointed a new chief executive and
received key financial backing Monday even as a political think
tank recommended tighter copyright laws to combat illegal swapping
of online music.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo, Calif., startup plans to expand its workforce and
office space now that it has closed a $15 million round of venture
funding led by noted San Francisco investment firm Hummer Winblad
Venture Partners, along with money from Angel Investors LP.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad partner Hank Barry, a onetime legal counsel for
major media companies like Disney Online and A&AMP;M Records, will
become Napster's interim CEO. He replaces Eileen Richardson, a
Boston area investor who became Napster's interim CEO when the
company started nine months ago. She only intended to stay long
enough to find a permanent boss.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barry, a former partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati
in Palo Alto, Calif., and Hummer Winblad partner John Hummer also
joined Napster's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was unavailable for immediate comment. But in a news
release, he cited a poll released last week that showed more than
70 percent of college students already use Napster, and nearly 20
percent use it daily, even though the company has yet to release a
final version of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``With over 10 million registered users within its first nine
months, Napster's file-sharing application has become the most
rapidly adopted technology in the history of the Internet,'' Barry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3
music files through the Internet. According to online and software
ratings firm Media Metrix Inc., Napster was ``virtually
nonexistent'' in February, but by March had 2.5 million unique
users.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and
new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica
and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a
tool for music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Napster blocked more than 300,000 users
identified by Metallica as people who were offering illegal copies
of the heavy metal band's songs. More than 30,000 have applied for
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Metallica quietly delivered a new list of 332,293
Napster members that the band wants blocked. Napster spokesman Dan
Wool said the company has not made a decision on blocking members
on the newest Metallica hit list or another list from Dr. Dre
naming 239,612 Napster members.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster debate has also entered the political arena. The
moderate Democratic party think tank Progressive Policy Institute
issued a report Monday calling for Congress to tighten the federal
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to hold Napster and similar
technology companies more accountable for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Napster is an innovative technology, but we should
use that technology in legal ways,'' said Robert Atkinson,
co-author of the report ``Napster and Online Piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that Congress change the DMCA to require
Internet-based services like Napster to obtain ``identifiable and
verifiable'' information about their users to help track down
copyright violators. Napster members can sign on anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the DMCA needs to have more specific
timetables for taking down copyright violators because it now gives
Napster and similar services ``no incentive to act in a timely
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that judges be allowed more flexibility to
grant injunctions. ``It may be impossible to write a law that
accounts for all future technological innovation, but a judge will
know a pirate's den when he or she sees it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute will present the paper at a House Small-Business
Committee hearing scheduled for tomorrow to examine Internet music
technologies, but Atkinson admitted he does not expect Congress to
act anytime in the next several months.
