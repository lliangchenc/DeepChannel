Socialists leave Basque coalition gov't over links with radicals

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Socialist party has pulled out of
the three-party Basque regional government because of links between
the coalition's principal member and an outside group allied to the
armed separatist organization ETA.
	   The Socialists, the leading opposition party in Spain's national
parliament, announced the split accusing the Basque Nationalist
Party of getting too close to Herri Batasuna, the political wing of
ETA.
	   Most parties in Spain have agreed to isolate Herri Batasuna
until it condemns ETA's violence. ETA, whose name stands for Basque
Homeland Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for Basque independence.
	   On Thursday, Basque regional government chief and Basque
Nationalist Party member Antonio Ardanza appointed three new
councilors to replace the Socialist representatives who resigned a
day earlier.
	   The split came just under four months before fresh regional
elections are held on Oct. 25.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party won 22 of the 75-seats in the 1994
ballot, has shared power with the Socialists who won 12 and the
Basque Union, which won eight.
	   In recent months the Basque Nationalist Party have promoted
attempts to bring Herri Batasuna into the fold so as to encourage a
political solution to the region's conflict.
	   The Basque region, located close to Spain's border with France,
is one of 17 semiautonomous regions in Spain.
