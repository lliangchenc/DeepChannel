Spain to move some Basque prisoners closer to home
</HEADLINE>

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque
separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their
home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group
ETA.
	   The announcement by the Interior Ministry came exactly three
months after ETA began observing an open-ended ceasefire in its
30-year battle for an independent homeland.
	   Since then, the government has been under pressure from both
hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream
Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on
its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred
to the Basque country, or at least closer to it.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself. Officials insisted this was for
humanitarian reasons only.
	   The government keeps more than 500 ETA prisoners scattered
around the country to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The interior ministry said 21 will be moved to jails in the
south of the mainland from prisons in the Canary Islands off the
coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean, or
from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the northern coast of
Morocco.
	   The ministry said the transfers would begin immediately. It
named the prisoners but did not list their crimes.
	   In November, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he had
authorized exploratory talks with parties close to ETA to determine
whether the group was prepared to renounce violence for good.
	   Aznar insists that the peace process cannot advance in earnest
without a permanent end to the violence. And even so, he says the
government is only willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other
issues involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated
demand of independence.
	   The group, whose name means Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for a separate homeland in
the Basque country, an area which straddles parts of northern Spain
and southern France.
