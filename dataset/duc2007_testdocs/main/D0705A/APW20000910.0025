<HEADLINE> Spain Bomb Blast Damages Disco  </HEADLINE>

   DEBA, Spain (AP) -- A bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's
northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the explosion shortly before 11 a.m., but
police said the bomb caused extensive damage to the Txitxarro
discotheque in the town of Deba, some 15 miles west of coastal city
of San Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   Basque police said a man identifying himself as a member of the
Basque armed group ETA warned of an imminent explosion at the
disco.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous caller also said that two people who were cleaning
inside the discotheque had been left handcuffed to a tree in the
road of Itziar toward Hendaya.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a hunter found a man and a woman tied to a
tree and reported it to police. The two confirmed that there were
no other people inside the discotheque at the time of the
explosion, which mainly damaged the building's roof.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Deba, Jesus Maria Aguirrezabala, said that the
target of the blast was the owner of the disco, Narciso Korta, who
is a brother of a businessmen killed in a car bomb in August. ETA
has claimed responsibility for that bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ETA regularly targets the Basque business community as part of
its independence campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A series of attacks by ETA in the last two months are seen as an
acceleration of the campaign of the armed group. It has been blamed
for about a dozen killings this year since it ended a 14-month
truce last December.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA started its
campaign for independence 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque
provinces in the north. It envisions an independent state that
would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural
identity and language. For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle
for sovereignty. But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals,
pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the
Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.
