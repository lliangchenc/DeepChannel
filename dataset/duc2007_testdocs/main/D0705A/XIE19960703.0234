MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Spanish political parties
will meet here next week to mobilize against the Basque separatist
group ETA, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said today.
</P>
<P>
The July 10 meeting is aimed at "uniting all democratic forces
in the struggle against terrorism," Mayor Oreja said.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the meeting will be those who adopted in 1987
a common stance in fighting the terrorist war launched by the ETA,
and have since formed a political alliance.
</P>
<P>
The national alliance has been allying with its regional
counterpart in Basque, in northern Spain, to quell the ETA, namely
the Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which came on after the ETA's week-long unilateral
truce ended Monday, was expected to strengthen the links between
the national and regional anti-terrorism alliances.
</P>
<P>
The Herri Batasuna party, the ETA's political wing, will be
excluded from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ETA has been fighting for a separate Basque state for 27
years. About 750 people were killed in the pro-independence war.
