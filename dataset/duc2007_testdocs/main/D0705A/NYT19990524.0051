 SPAIN FACING ITS OWN FEARS ON SEPARATISM  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  BILBAO, Spain _ As NATO rushes troops and equipment to the
Balkans, a powerful ethnic separatist movement is building toward a
showdown on the Alliance's own Atlantic flank.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with unprecedented political opposition and public
anger, Spanish rule in Basque country is close to foundering _
adding a Western European chapter to the breakups that have
shattered Yugoslavia and other Eastern European countries since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a unified Basque-nationalist regional
government was elected in October, following the declaration of a
cease-fire by ETA, the underground separatist army that has waged a
bloody 30-year war against Madrid. The cease-fire was answered by
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar with a hard-line crackdown, deeply
alienating most voters and ending decades of cooperation between
Basque moderates and Spanish political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make gestures. I apply the law,'' Aznar says about his
refusal to meet the cease-fire with conciliatory measures, much
less peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's essentially no contact anymore between our people and
the central government,'' says Gorka Agirre, a leader of the
mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) in Bilbao, the region's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fathers and grandfathers could only &LR;   &LR; dream of a free
Basque land. My generation believes that we will actually create
one,'' says Dabid Lizarralde, 21, a university student in the
coastal town of Algorta, 10 miles north of Bilbao, as long-distance
runners swept by in a province-wide race organized to support
Basque language studies.
</P>
<P>
   The runners, backed by $35 donations for each kilometer, were
diverted around the town center to avoid colliding with a parade
sponsored by Herri Batasuna, the political arm of ETA. They passed
directly in front of an 8 p.m. demonstration by parents of Basque
political prisoners that has occupied Algorta's main intersection
every evening for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of the town's 13 sons and daughters in Spanish prisons
were posted in taverns, restaurants and shops. Greeted by musicians
playing Basque folk songs on traditional instruments, crowds of
people poured out of the local railroad station from yet other
demonstrations in Bilbao, including a silent protest march that
blocks the city's principal thoroughfare each Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Basque country in 1999 recalls Prague or Budapest a decade ago,
when endless demonstrations and a sense of history-in-the-making
brought ordinary life to a giddy standstill.
</P>
<P>
   There are echoes, too, of the violent Kurdish separatist war
that has killed thousands in Turkey, and of stubborn ethnic
nationalist movements that have troubled other NATO governments
during the past few years in Scotland and Wales, Corsica, northern
Italy, Flemish Belgium and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Basque nationalists follow all of these movements closely, and
maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with several, in what amounts
to a de facto alliance of ``stateless nations'' inside NATO that
stretches from the British Isles to the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The new regional government has invited the outlawed Kurdish
parliament to convene in Bilbao in July, and it protested the sales
of arms manufactured by Spanish firms in Basque country to the
Turkish government. Madrid has officially prohibited the
convention, setting the stage for a confrontation over Basque ties
to the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   But the closest kinship is with Ireland, where the very
institutions and tactics of separatist rebellion are cut from the
same cloth _ and where the connection has a six-decade history,
speaks in the lilting brogue of Dublin and has a Basque family
name: Gallastegi.
</P>
<P>
   Now an energetic 73, Iker Gallastegi arrived in Ireland in
September 1937 at age 10 with his parents and five siblings. It was
the height of the Spanish Civil War, and Basque country was in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Gallastegi, Iker's father, was a leading Basque nationalist,
singled out for liquidation by General Francisco Franco's Fascists
when the family fled Spain. Dublin was already his second home.
Inspired by the stubborn Irish fight for independence, the elder
Gallastegi had written a history of the 1916 Easter Rising against
British rule, and in 1932 founded a trading firm in Bilbao to
import eggs, potatoes and pork from the young Irish Free State.
</P>
<P>
   In their Dublin exile, the Gallastegi children were raised on an
uncompromising mixture of Basque separatism and Irish
republicanism. Eventually, that education led Iker himself to
return to Basque country as a young nationalist organizer in 1952
under an assumed name, and to flee once again just ahead of
Franco's police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to beat the dust in 1952,'' he says. ``It was 17 years
before I was able to return home, after Franco was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellious family tradition has carried into the next
generation. Gallastegi's daughter Usune, 35, has been in a Spanish
prison since 1994, sentenced to an eight-year term for
``collaborating with terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between Ireland and Basque country that began with
the Gallastegis continue at a brisk clip today. ``We're not
married, but you could surely say that we are living together,''
says Gallastegi.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a set of matched political structures that frame,
in tandem, Western Europe's two oldest ethnic nationalist
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships between the underground ETA and Herri Batasuna
_ and major elements in their strategy, training and recruitment
methods _ are mirror images of the relationship between Sinn Fein,
the militant but legal Irish political party, and its own armed
wing, the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has made at least half a dozen
visits to Bilbao, according to Herri Batasuna officials, and other
high-ranking members of the two parties consult regularly on
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   During several assignments in and around Belfast in recent
years, a Chronicle reporter encountered visiting groups of
militants from Jarrai, the Herri Batasuna youth organization,
boisterously participating in Republican political demonstrations.
So boisterously, in fact, that republican leaders were obliged to
restrain the young Basques, who in one instance tried to lead a
headlong charge against police lines.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish police charge that these visits include military field
training under IRA supervision, and they allege that Jarrai is
behind a spate of firebombings directed at officials of Aznar's
conservative People's Party in Basque country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the ties extend to a working relationship between
ETA and IRA on some level. There's a tremendous amount of traffic
back and forth between Bilbao and Belfast,'' acknowledges a Basque
leader, speaking off the record. ``But that's not something to be
discussed publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Northern Ireland, where the Royal Ulster Constabulary is
effectively a Protestant police force, Basques face a law
enforcement agency _ Spain's Guardia Civil _ that employs virtually
no members of its own community.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another echo of Irish Republican tactics, Herri Batasuna
has compiled lengthy lists of unmarked police car license plate
numbers and has posted them in popular taverns run by the party in
nearly every Basque town and village.
</P>
<P>
   Like its significant other in Ireland, Herri Batasuna ran
candidates in regional elections for three decades, only to decline
the seats it won in protest against ``foreign rule.'' Then, last
year, the IRA declared a permanent cease-fire, and Sinn Fein sat
down at the negotiating table with its adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, ETA and Herri Batasuna followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a dramatic September meeting in the city of
Lizarra, 70 miles south of Bilbao, at which all nine nationalist
political parties and 14 Basque labor and cultural organizations
issued a joint declaration calling for multiparty negotiations
toward self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Lizarra, the football field had always been the Spanish
state,'' says Eusebio Lasa, a member of Herri Batasuna's national
council. ``What we decided at Lizarra is that the field must be
Basque country itself _ that the future should be up to the Basque
people and not simply concessions from officials in Madrid.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled consciously on the Good Friday Agreement in Northern
Ireland, the Lizarra Declaration set the stage for the election,
one month later, that ushered in the unprecedented nationalist-run
regional government.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the moderate PNV, Herri Batasuna and a third
nationalist party now hold 41 seats in the regional parliament,
against 30 for the People's Party (PP) and the Socialists. ``The
situation has changed enormously,'' says Gorka Agirre of the PNV,
which leads the new governing coalition, the first in history not
to include either the Socialist Party or the PP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree now (with Herri Batasuna) that there was no great
difference between those two parties when it came to Basques.
Neither was interested in talking about a different future here,
about any real self-determination,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   PNV leaders point out that few, if any, regional autonomy
measures promised as long ago as the 1970s were implemented when
the Socialists or conservatives were part of the regional governing
coalition. According to the Spanish constitution, even a referendum
on self-determination in Basque country remains strictly against
the law.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Irish experience no longer fits the Basque
reality. The Good Friday Agreement was reached under the auspices
of a British government desperate to extricate itself from the
Northern Ireland quagmire, and more than happy to have the end game
played in Belfast rather than London.
</P>
<P>
   The problems since in implementing self-rule in Northern Ireland
have not come from 10 Downing Street, but from die-hard factions
within the unionist and republican camps.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no war in Basque country between
communities, no exchange of atrocities between Bilbao versions of
the Catholic and Protestant gunmen who haunt Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy isn't the Spanish lad next door,'' says Gallastegi.
``It's the national state,'' in the form of a central government
that responded to the historic cease-fire by arresting the very
people with whom it must negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived in power, I said, `I will never talk with ETA.'
If there is no peace, ETA and ETA alone will be responsible,'' says
Aznar, pointing out that ETA has been responsible for more than 800
killings in the past three decades, mostly of government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is peace, there is discussion. Without discussion,
there is no place for peace,'' counters the Rev. Pierre Moleres,
bishop of the predominantly Basque city of Bayonne in France.
Moleres' offer to help arrange negotiations was rejected by the
Aznar government, which opposes any international mediation in the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown began just as Basque nationalists were laying the
groundwork for the cease-fire in October 1997, when the entire
23-member leadership council of Herri Batasuna was sentenced to
lengthy jail terms for distributing a video that presented ETA's
terms for peace. According to many observers, the imprisoned
council members were the most negotiation-minded of the
organization's factions to hold sway in years. They join more than
500 Basque political activists now in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ETA militants have been found dead, under suspicious
circumstances that recall the work of secret assassination squads
in the 1980s that were linked to the Socialist government of Felipe
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, under pressure from Madrid, French police rounded
up six more nationalist leaders in Paris. Gallastegi's niece
Irantzu, a key figure in the ETA bid for peace, was one of those
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort we've made to search an accord with Aznar, to
promote dialogue, has been negative,'' says PNV's Agirre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I want peace,'' Aznar insists. ``But they are trying to
obtain independence. That's the difference between us.''
