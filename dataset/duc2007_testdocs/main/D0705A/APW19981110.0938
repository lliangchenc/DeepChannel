	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any
discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the
armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Josep Pique said the government would only negotiate
terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than
500 ETA prisoners in jails around Spain.
	   ``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,''
Pique told reporters in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
	   ``No one should think there is going to be any kind of political
negotiation on the basis of what might arise when the violence
ends,'' he added.
	   Pique was speaking a day after a senior official from the
opposition Socialist party warned that ETA, which began observing
an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 18, was attempting to force
full-blown talks on the future of the Basque country as its price
for renouncing violence for good.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, flush with a strong showing by
his center-right Popular Party in Basque regional elections on Oct.
25, said last Tuesday his government is willing to hold preliminary
talks with ETA.
	   The purpose of these discussions, the government said, would be
for ETA to confirm that it really wants peace.
	   Two days later ETA issued a statement that fell short of
promising a permanent end to violence. The document was dated
before Aznar's offer.
	   In it ETA supported a Basque nationalist peace proposal that
calls for a two-track process made up of negotiations between the
government and ETA, on issues like weapons and prisoners, and
separate all-party talks on the future of the Basque country.
	   These latter discussions would touch on ETA's stated goal of
independence, according to this blueprint signed by a broad range
of nationalist Basque parties and known as the Lizarra Declaration
after a town in Spain's northern Basque region.
	   Pique's remarks ruling out talks on independence come as both
sides jockey to shape a peace-talks agenda that suits them best,
with the government seeking to keep it as narrow as possible, while
ETA is trying to push it open.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.
