<HEADLINE> Crowd Rallies for Basque Fighters  </HEADLINE>

   BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- Pumping their fists in the air to shouts of
''Long live ETA!'' several thousand people paid tribute Saturday to
four young Basque separatists who blew themselves up by accident,
reportedly while preparing an attack.
</P>
<P>
   A police helicopter hovered in overcast skies as Arnaldo Otegi,
leader of the pro-ETA Basque coalition Euskal Herritarrok, pointed
to poster-size photographs of the four -- two of them just 22 years
old -- and praised them as freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Police had feared incidents between the crowd and opponents of
ETA, the armed Basque separatist group, but the rally went off
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before crowd waving red, white and green Basque flags,
Otegi said it was a pity that men so young had to die in the Basque
conflict. He blamed the Spanish government, saying it had to yield
to what he called Basques' desire for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not choose violence, but there is no other path,''
Otegi said at the rally in the heart of Bilbao, the largest and
richest Basque city.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's armed drive for an independent homeland carved out of
parts of northern Spain and southern France has claimed nearly 800
lives since it began in 1968. In the Basque language, ETA stands
for Basque Freedom and Homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the four ETA members who died had intended to
launch an attack on Bilbao. On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a suit
against Otegi, accusing him of advocating terrorism after he
described the four who died as ''colleagues and patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, suspected supporters of the armed group threw
a firebomb at a Civil Guard member's home in the latest in a series
of small-scale attacks in the northern Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the incident in Vitoria, the region's
capital. The house, belonging to a Civil Guard member who was not
identified, was damaged by fire as the guardsman's 17-year-old son
was inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three days, assailants have thrown Molotov
cocktails at bank offices, burnt some 13 buses and dozens of cars
and attacked automatic teller machines in different Basque cities.
They have been protesting the deaths of the four suspected ETA
members.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ETA claimed responsibility for 12 attacks between
early May and late July. But the armed group did not mention a
shooting of an army officer Wednesday or two car bombings that
killed a Basque business leader and injured 11 people Tuesday.
Police and politicians have blamed ETA.
