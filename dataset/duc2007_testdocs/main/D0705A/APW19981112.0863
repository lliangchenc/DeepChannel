	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and the Basque militant group ETA have made direct
contact for the first time, taking a step toward new peace talks, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The communication was limited to a recognition that the
government and ETA would have future contacts, the daily El Mundo
reported, quoting unnamed government sources.
	   Aznar last week authorized contacts with ETA, and promised to
inform the public of all developments related to the Basque peace
process
	   But Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office refused to
comment, saying that the delicacy of the issue requires discretion.
	   The latest possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA announced an
indefinite cease-fire.
	   Spain's government gradually softened its position on the truce,
with initial skepticism turning into a promise of dialogue. The
government insists, however, that the agenda will not include the
subject of Basque independence.
	   The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of
ETA's 535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up
violence forever.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom _
has killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez was in office. The
talks broke down and the violence resumed.
