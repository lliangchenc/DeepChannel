	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an
independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   ETA said it killed Tomas Caballero _ a town councilor from the
northern city of Pamplona _ on May 6 and retired Civil Guard
officer Alfonso Parada two days later some 80 kilometers (50 miles)
farther east in the town of Vitoria.
	   In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical
Basque newspaper Elgin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the
slayings and several other recent attacks.
	   Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth
slayings attributed to ETA this year.
	   It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before
taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Egin.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for
independence.
