Former ETA leader asks government for first step with prisoners
</HEADLINE>

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A former leader of the Basque separatist
group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners
to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace
talks.
	   ``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region,
this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as
Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose
Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
	   Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving
time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group. He was let
out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he
won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct. 25.
	   Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members
held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the
Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
	   One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be
moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
	   ETA declared an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 16. The government
has responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is
prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
	   But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the
government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way
for talks.
	   In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry
last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in
hospitals of their choice.
