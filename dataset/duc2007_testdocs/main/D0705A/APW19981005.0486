	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen
provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's Basque conflict and
the international community, particularly the United States, has a
duty to help bring this about, Irish republican leader Gerry Adams
said Monday.
	   ``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United
States is the most powerful,'' Adams, who heads the IRA-linked Sinn
Fein party, told a press conference shortly after arriving in this
northern Basque town.
	   ``We would be calling on the international community to assist
in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country
where an initiative has been taken,'' said Adams.
	   Adams was greeted at the start of his half-day stay by some 100
Basque independence supporters waving Irish and Basque flags.
	   The Irish leader was expected to be handed a proposal for
all-party peace talks signed by Basque nationalist parties grouped
together in the so-called ``Irish Forum.''
	   The forum is hopeful Adams will pass its proposal on to
President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month. Adams
described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as
``crucial and pivotal.''
	   A copy of the appeal _ credited with encouraging the armed
Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce _ has already been
sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United
Nations.
	   On Sept 18, ETA began an indefinite and condition-free
cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it
hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern
France. The organization, whose name is an acronym in the Basque
language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800
people since 1968.
	   The Spanish government has long ruled out ETA's demand for a
self-determination vote for Basques.
	   The Irish Forum claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland
peace process and its success in opening the door for a political
settlement in the troubled British province.
	   Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams _ whose Sinn Fein
party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party
allied to ETA _ called on the Spanish government to put aside its
``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that
ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a
peace process be set in motion.
	   During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a
Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell on the
outskirts of Bilbao.
	   Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders
convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral
broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen called for peace
talks.
	   ETA commanded considerable support in the Basque region and
elsewhere in Spain during the final years of the 1939-75
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   Today, however, most people believe an armed campaign for
independence cannot be justified given the level of self-government
the Basque region enjoys since democracy returned in 1978.
	   Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday.
