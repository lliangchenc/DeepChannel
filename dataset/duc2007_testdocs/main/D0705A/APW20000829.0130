<HEADLINE> Politician Gunned Down in Spain  </HEADLINE>

   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- A politician was gunned down Tuesday
in the street of a northern town in the latest in a series of
slayings blamed on the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Indiano, 29, was shot 10 times in the chest and abdomen
outside his candy store in Zumarraga, a Basque town, about 250
miles north of Madrid, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiano, who authorities said refused police protection normally
offered politicians in the Basque region, died in the town's
hospital an hour after the attack. His wife, pregnant with their
first child, was admitted to a hospital later in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Although not a member of the governing Popular Party, Indiano
became a councilor in Zumarraga for the party six months ago. The
conservative party fiercely opposes Basque separatism and other
moves to change Spain's political makeup.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for the shooting, but Interior
Ministry officials immediately blamed ETA, which began its campaign
for independence of the three-province northern region in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The killing brought to 12 the number of slayings -- five this
month -- attributed to ETA since it ended a 14-month truce last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has been blamed for killing nearly 800 people. It normally claims
responsibility for its attacks several weeks after carrying them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the latest ETA campaign seeks to push the
government to the negotiating table. A single round of talks during
last year's truce ended in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was condemned by political parties, labor unions and
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are faced once again with the confirmation that the
terrorist group ETA has no other aim but to impose its will on
others and exterminate all those who don't think like they do,''
said deputy Prime Minister Marian Rajoy.
</P>
<P>
   Indiano's body was to be brought to Madrid, where his parents
live, for burial Wednesday, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday evening in Bilbao, San
Sebastian and Vitoria, the capitals of the three Basque provinces,
to observe a few minutes of silence. The quiet was broken by
periodic shouts against ETA.
</P>
<P>
   In Zumarraga itself, at a special town meeting called to condemn
the killing, one of three councilors who belong to the pro-ETA
party Euskal Herritarrok tried to read a communique but was drowned
out by shouts of ''murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   While security force members have long been ETA's main target,
in recent years the organization has begun killing more
politicians, particularly those of Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar's Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, who was on a visit to Poland on Tuesday, survived a
car-bomb attempt on his life in 1995 when he was in the opposition.
