	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's election time in Spain's troubled
Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of attempts to end three
decades of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by
ETA rebels fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
	   Basque nationalists this week urged ETA, one of Europe's few
remaining armed political groups, to renounce bloodshed so that a
political solution can be found.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political
groups, including radical ETA-linked political party Herri
Batasuna, took a joint position on the issue. Their so-called
Lizarra Declaration calls for peace talks and a permanent end to
the violence.
	   But when asked Wednesday about the possibility of an ETA
cease-fire, Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said, ``It
would be a trick truce.''
	   ETA, the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France. The
group has killed 800 people since it took up arms 30 years ago, and
was extremely active during the Socialist administration of
ex-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the early 1980s, killing
dozens of police officers every year.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged
the rebels to stop the killing.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not
negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces
violence.
	   The Lizarra Declaration came out of a forum promoted by Herri
Batasuna and held in the Basque city of Lizarra. It was signed by
representatives of 23 political parties, labor unions and
grassroots groups. but the forum was boycotted by Spain's two most
powerful political parties, the ruling Popular Party and the
opposition Socialists.
	   ETA declared a truce for one week in 1996. It ended with a
series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the government
refused to negotiate unless ETA renounced violence.
