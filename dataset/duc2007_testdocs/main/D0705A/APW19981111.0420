Spain considering paying damages for anti-Basque death squad

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is
considering paying damages to relatives of people killed by
government-backed death squads that targeted Basque separatists in
the 1980s when his Socialist predecessors were in power, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``This is a subject that is being analyzed now. That is all
there is to say,'' spokesman Josep Pique told reporters.
	   The death squads, which called themselves the Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups, or GAL, killed 27 people from 1983 to 1987 in a
campaign designed to crush the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   Jose Barrionuevo, interior minister under then-Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, and his deputy for state security, Rafael Vera,
are serving 10-year jail terms for their role in organizing a
botched 1983 kidnapping that marked the GAL's first act.
	   Pique also rejected a call Tuesday by ETA's political wing,
Herri Batasuna, for a blanket amnesty for more than 500 jailed ETA
members as a way to end decades of separatist conflict.
	   He reiterated the government position that if ETA, which
declared a ceasefire Sept. 16, renounces violence for good,
officials are willing to consider transferring some ETA prisoners
to jails in or near the Basque country in line with a long-standing
ETA demand.
	   Pique also said the government is ``still waiting'' for a
response from ETA to Aznar's offer of exploratory talks to discuss
whether the group is willing to renounce violence.
	   The government insists that if full-blown peace talks do get
underway, it is prepared to discuss only the prisoner issue and ETA
disarmament, not ETA's stated goal of an independent Basque
homeland.
	   ETA is a Basque-language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom. Its bombings and shootings in the Basque country and
elsewhere in Spain have left nearly 800 people dead since 1968.
