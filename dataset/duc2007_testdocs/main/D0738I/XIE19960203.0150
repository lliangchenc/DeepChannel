LIMA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru's mining production is
expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international
metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said
today.

<P>
Peru's copper output in 1995 was 480,000 tons and its copper
export earned 800 million U.S. dollars.

Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and

The sources forecast that gold output in Peru, which is rich in
mineral resources, will be more than 65 tons in 1996 due to an
investment of 26 million dollars in gold projects in the San Jose
de Yanacocha and Retamas zones.
