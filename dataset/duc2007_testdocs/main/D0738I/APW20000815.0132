<HEADLINE> Peru Fines Mine For Mercury Spill  </HEADLINE>

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Peruvian government fined Latin America's
largest gold mine $500,000 for a mercury spill in June that
poisoned dozens of Andean villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was announced Tuesday in a legal notice in the
government's official newspaper, El Peruano.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Yanacocha gold mine had already pledged to
pay all costs for medical treatment and environmental cleanup.
Company officials last month cited 70 confirmed cases of mercury
contamination.

   A local midwife was the only person to fall gravely ill, lapsing
into a coma, said Andres Vargas, associate director of the Regional
Hospital of Cajamarca, 350 miles north of the capital, Lima.

   On June 2, a truck carrying mercury from the Yanacocha gold mine
spilled about 3 gallons of the toxic liquid metal in the village of
Choropampa, according to the Newmont Mining Company of Denver,
which has a 51.4 percent stake in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury leaked onto a road near the village, 53 miles
southwest of the mine, while it was being transported by a private
trucking firm, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury, a byproduct of the mining operation, is sold to a
Lima-based firm that uses it for medical equipment.
