SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Private mines in Chile will
have produced 1.9 million metric tons of refined copper in 1996,
marking an increase of 41.7 percent over 1995, according to the
National Mining Society (SONAMI).

The SONAMI said the dynamic growth this year in the private
mining sector had consolidated Chile as the world's leading copper
producer. It said the increasing momentum would become more
accentuated in the next three years.

Private mines were estimated to produce 3.2 million metric tons
of refined copper, with the total production for the country
reaching 4.7 million metric tons.

Output of state-run copper mines would rise to 1.2 million
metric tons in 1996, with new mining projects, including El Abra,
Refugio, Santa Barbara, Mantoverde, Andacollo-copper and
Anacollo-gold, going into operation, the Mining Society said.
