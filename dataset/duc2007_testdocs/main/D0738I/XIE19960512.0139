<HEADLINE> Rich Gold Mine Discovered in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A rich gold seam with estimated
reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been
discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Newmont Mining Corporation and the Peruvian company
Buenaventura have been jointly exploiting the Yanacocha gold mine
in northwest Peru for the last two years. The mine is already a
major gold producer -- output last year rose 15 per cent to 620,000
ounces.

<P>
Commercial exploitation of the new deposit could start after
1998, a company spokesman said after the completion of
infrastructure, including a power generation plant and
telecommunications system.
