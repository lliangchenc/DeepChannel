Venezualan Indians injured by National Guard at protest

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The National Guard sprayed tear gas
and shot rubber bullets Wednesday at a group of Indians protesting
the construction of a high-voltage electricity line in the Amazon
jungle.
	   The Indians said three of their members were hospitalized with
injuries, a version denied by the National Guard.
	   About 350 members of the Pemon tribe in southern Bolivar state
occupied the site where crews planned to begin erecting an
electricity tower Wednesday. Within hours, national guardsmen
arrived and ``attacked the community,'' said Jose Luis Gonzalez,
head of the state's Indigenous Federation.
	   Gonzalez said the three victims included 13-year-old Orangel
Pulido, who he said suffered eye damage when a tear-gas bomb
exploded in his face.
	   Gen. Pedro Zambrano, state leader of the National Guard, told
The Associated Press that ``we cannot speak of injuries.''
	   But he did confirm ``there were some shots of rubber bullets and
tear gas bombs were used.''
	   For the past month, the Pemon tribe has been trying to block the
300-mile (480-kilometer) power line's construction, saying it will
damage the environment by supplying electricity to gold mining
companies that want to set up operations in the Imataca rain
forest.
