<HEADLINE> Iranian Official: Only Khamenei Can Cancel Death Sentence on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel
the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at
presidential office said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The decree [death sentence] has not been cancelled. No one,
except for Ayatollah Khamenei, can revise the decree," the
official at presidential office told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The official at presidential office who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that since the decree was issued by a religious
scholar of the high stature of Khomeini it could not be changed by
officials.
</P>
<P>
"Only Ayatollah Khamenei, as the Supreme Jurisprudent, can
revise decrees issued by the late Imam," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of
death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in
protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic
Verses", and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities have given into tremendous pressures
from the European Union after the death of Khomeini, promising
not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference
here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill
Rushdie. Similar assurances have been given to European Union by
President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference
here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue
of Islamic law and that "it was not essentially an Executive
issue."
</P>
<P>
The official at presidential office said that Rafsanjani wanted
to draw the attention to the religious importance of the
decree.
</P>
<P>
"The president wanted to make a distinction between a
religious, jurisprudential decree and an executive, administrative
one," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The British with their hue and cry wanted to make it sound
that the decree was an executive one," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In fact it was the British themselves who did not want to
have this issue resolved and even now their actions show they do
not seek an end to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's Monday statement on Rushdie has drawn criticism
from a national newspaper Jomhuri Eslami.
</P>
<P>
The paper issued an editorial Tuesday, saying that
Rushdie still has to face death sentence because "no one has
the right to change the divine command."
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of all Moslems to kill anyone who
would insult the Blessed Progeny of Prophet Muhammad, the Holy
Koran and Islamic sanctities," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
"This punishment has to be done regardless of time, place and
individuals involved. The decree is not a governmental or
personal decree and hence cannot be changed to adjust to new
political conditions," it warned.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the indirect talks on Salman Rushdie
between EU and Tehran is producing some understanding. The two
sides have agreed the case be regarded merely as a religious and
theoretical issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that with U.S. pressures mounting on Iran,
Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to
gain the cooperation of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether, but how, to withdraw from
previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both
at home and abroad," a political analyst here said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities also face tremendous pressure and
opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the
issue of Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have stated recently that they want to
adopt a protective stance with regard to issues such as
Rushdie affair.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the
case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively
put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent
disputes such as Rushdie affairs.
