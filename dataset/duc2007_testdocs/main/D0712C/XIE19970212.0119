<HEADLINE> Iranian Foundation Raises Reward for Killing Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A private Iranian foundation
has raised its reward for killing British author Salman Rushdie
from 2 million U.S. dollars to 2.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared in a press
conference held here today that the reward has nothing to do
with the government, claiming, "The government policy still
remains the same."
</P>
<P>
The Persian Daily Jumhuri Islami reported today that Ayatollah
Sheikh Jassan Sanai'e, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei and head of the Khordad Foundation, has announced the
decision for raising the reward.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the clergyman made the announcement on
the occasion of the 8th anniversary of the issuance of the decree
on the Indian-born author of the book of "Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Muslim fundamentalists, who consider the book blasphemous for
its irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's
founder, reacted very strongly after the book was published in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Sanai'e said that the interests on the reward money would also
be paid to the executor of the decree right from the beginning,
adding, "There is nothing more (important) to the foundation than
seeing Imam Khomeini's decree executed."
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence
of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the
publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran, given tremendous pressures from the European
Union (EU) after the death of Khomeini, has promised not to
dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities reportedly face tremendous pressure and
opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on
the issue.
