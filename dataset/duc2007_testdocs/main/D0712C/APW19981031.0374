	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological
students have pledged a month's salary toward a bounty for the
killing of British author Salman Rushdie, an Iranian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was
condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic,
ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous.
	   In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with
Iran after Tehran distanced itself from the bounty. But the move
has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of the government of
President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
	   In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest
Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict against Salman
Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
	   ``Thousands have also signed up to give a month's wages to any
person who carries out the historical edict against Salman
Rushdie,'' the Farsi-language newspaper added.
	   Seminary students in Qom receive monthly stipends of about
200,000 rials (dlrs 66) and teachers earn about 300,000 rials (dlrs
100).
	   Last month a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
The move followed the government's distancing itself from the
reward.
	   Last month residents of a north Iranian village offered land and
carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.
