<HEADLINE> Iran-Norway Ties Might Worsen over Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran warned on Sunday it's ties
with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues support for
Salman Rushdie, a British writer condemned to death by Iran for
his "blasphemous" novel.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the offensive policies by Norway might
force Iran to further limit its ties with the country," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said, quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Iran's late Spiritual
Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei for his novel "the Satanic
Verses," which was regarded as an insult to the Islamic Prophet
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a recent meeting between Norwegian Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik and Rushdie, Mohammadi said "the meeting
constituted a support for Rushdie's desecration of Islamic
sanctities."
</P>
<P>
He said Norway's move defied the new international consensus
which views understanding among nations and dialogue among
cultures and civilizations necessary for peaceful coexistence in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Norway recalled their ambassadors in December 1994
over Norway's support for Rushdie and their ties have since been
kept at the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the restrictions Iran imposed on its commercial
and political relations with Norway would continue "unabatedly."
