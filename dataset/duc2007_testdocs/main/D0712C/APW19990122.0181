<HEADLINE> U2 Writes Song With Salman Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Author Salman Rushdie has contributed lyrics to a  
new song by the Irish rock band U2, The Guardian newspaper reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie, who has lived in hiding for nearly a decade since being  
condemned to death by Iran's supreme leader for his 1989 book ``The 
Satanic Verses,'' gave U2 lead singer Bono the lyrics taken from 
his new novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The romantic ballad, also to be called ``The Ground Beneath Her  
Feet,'' will be on U2's next album, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bono and I have been friends for several years, and I sent him  
the novel when I'd finished it, and he responded by coming up with 
this beautiful melody,'' the newspaper quoted Rushdie as saying. 
``Simple as that, but of course very pleasurable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie's literary agency declined to comment on The Guardian's  
report.

	The newspaper said U2 hopes to release the single to coincide  
with the April 13 release of Rushdie's novel. The lyrics for the 
song are included in the novel, which tells the myth of Orpheus and 
Eurydice against a rock 'n' roll background, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The author's collaboration with U2 would not be his first: He  
appeared on stage with the band in London in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah  
Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic 
republic, ruled ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the Iranian government said it was distancing itself  
from the edict, but hard-liners insist there's still a price on the 
author's head.
