EU welcomes Iranian government decision in Rushdie case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union on Monday welcomed a
move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic
edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two
senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
	   In a statement issued here, the EU said the Iranian decision
opens the way for closer cooperation between Europe and the Tehran
government.
	   The statement was issued here because Austria holds the rotating
EU presidency.
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain also has sought
better ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran,
which have gone to France and other European countries.
	   On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced
his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
He did not, however, say that the government was rescinding the
edict.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   In Tehran, however, two influential clerics -- Grand Ayatollah
Mohammad Fazel Lankarani and Grand Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani -- were
quoted as saying the edict, or fatwa, must be enforced and no one
can reverse it.
