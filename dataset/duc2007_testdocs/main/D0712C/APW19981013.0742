	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ About 1,000 hard-liners, many of them
militia volunteers, demonstrated outside Tehran University on
Tuesday, shouting that the religious edict against writer Salman
Rushdie remained in force.
	   The demonstration occurred as Abdollah Nouri, a deputy to
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, delivered a speech at the
university on civil liberties.
	   One of the hard-liners tried to hit Nouri as he was leaving the
campus, but four body guards protected him and whisked him away in
his car.
	   Nouri, who is a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was
attacked along with Ataollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture
and Islamic guidance, on Sept. 4 by militants.
	   The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie.
	   ``The edict is irrevocable, and we emphasize the implementation
of this edict against apostate Salman Rushdie independent of any
diplomatic negotiations conducted by Iran's government,'' said a
statement distributed by the Basij Resistance Forces, a militia
that assists the army in wartime.
	   A ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his
book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous.
	   Khatami's government has tried to distance itself from offers by
Iranian groups to pay money to anyone implementing the fatwa.
	   On Monday, a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million
to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.
	   The edict has strained ties between Iran and the West,
especially Britain. Britain restored diplomatic relations last
month after Khatami's government distanced itself from the reward
offering.
	   Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding after Khomeini
issued the edict, expressed relief that the ordeal was over.
