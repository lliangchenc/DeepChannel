TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati will start his two-day official visit Tuesday to
Italy in a bid improve the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian foreign minister today declined to comment
on whether the thorny issue of the Salman Rushdie affairs will be
dealt with during his forthcoming trip to Italy.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British
author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the
publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was
accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry
out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "the main purpose of this trip is to pay an
official visit to Rome and talk to the high-ranking officials of
that country about bilateral, regional and international
cooperation between Iran and Italy."
</P>
<P>
An Iranian source from the Foreign Ministry said that Velayati
will also call on Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
Ludovico Ortona, Italian Ambassador to Iran, has already left
for Rome to make preparations for the high-level bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Iran-Italian economic relations will be
on the top of agenda between Velayati and his Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Iran signed an agreement in November for several
industrial projects totalling 561 million U.S. dollars, which
will be financed by the Italian Bank Medtocredito along with a
number of other banks from England, France, Japan, Netherlands
and Germany.
