<HEADLINE> Iran Drops Death Sentence on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer
accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure
from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press
conference this morning that "the death sentence was never meant
to be carried out."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani attacked Europe, especially Britain, for their lack
of resolve to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The Europeans, especially the British, made hue and
cry over it. Even now they do not allow it to be solved."
</P>
<P>
"The fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini can be found in all the
books on Islamic law for the past 1,000 years. He only said
something which existed in these books," Rafsanjani added.
</P>
<P>
"We really do not think it is prudent that we would dwell on
this issue so much," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the indirect Tehran-EU talks on Salman
Rushdie is producing some understanding. The two sides have agreed
that the case should be regarded merely as a religious and
theoretical issue.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the
Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in
protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic
Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and
exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Rafsanjani told prominent Egyptian journalist Muhammad
Hassanein Haykal that there was a difference between a fatwa
(ruling) and hokm (command). He said that Khomeini did not mean
the death sentence to be a command.
</P>
<P>
An observer here said that with U.S. pressure mounting on
Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue
to gain cooperation of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians no longer want any of the troubles they went
through over the Rushdie issue," one observer said.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether but how to withdraw from previous
position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home
and abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here
last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the
case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively
put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent
disputes such as the Rushdie affair.
