	   LONDON (AP) _ British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran
distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said
Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
	   ``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said. ``It means
everything.''
	   Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the
development that came out British talks with Iran in New York,
Rushdie said: ``It seems that this has been done in Iran with
consensus.''
	   Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the
decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream
opposition within Iran.
	   ``An extraordinary thing has been achieved,'' Rushdie said.
	   Publication of Salman Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988
caused an uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that
it insulted Islam. The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty
on the Indian-born British writer's head.
	   At the United Nations in New York, Iran's foreign minister said
his government was distancing itself from the reward for killing
Rushdie, and was ready to exchange ambassadors with Britain.
	   Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Kharrazi on the
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session, said he was
delighted with Iran's decision.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said after the meeting.
