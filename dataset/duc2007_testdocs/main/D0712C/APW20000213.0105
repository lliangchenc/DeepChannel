<HEADLINE> Rushdie Sentence Said in Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence
ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the
Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it,
an Iranian radio report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and
nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according
to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. on the eve of
the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on divine principles, ... the ruling against the apostate Salman
Rushdie is still valid and nothing can change this,'' the statement reportedly
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Khomeini announced the sentence on Feb. 14, claiming Rushdie had
blasphemed Islam in ``The Satanic Verses,'' the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly
a decade in hiding under police protection.
</P>
<P>
	   He emerged from his shadowy existence in September 1998 when Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced the country was distancing itself from a $2.5
million reward promised for Rushdie's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran had been trying to change its foreign policy since Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric, took over as president in August 1997. He underscored the need
to replace confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rushdie affair was the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain and Iran agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslims have said before that the fatwa cannot be lifted formally, but the
Iranian government's decision did ease the threat to Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
	   Powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always supported the
death sentence and are likely to continue to do so.
