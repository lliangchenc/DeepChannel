 &UR; Iranian foundation raises reward for killing Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000
to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the
Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
	   ``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to
the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii
was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.
