	   The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the
Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
	   ``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign
minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam
Khomeini ... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all
over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
	   Last week, more half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament
signed a letter saying the death edict against Rushdie still
stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.
