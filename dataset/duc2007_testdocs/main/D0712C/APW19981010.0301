	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A hard-line Iranian student group has
offered 1 billion riyals (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman
Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
	   The move came just weeks after the relatively moderate
government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from the
death edict and an earlier reward of dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the
announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained
strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemed Islam. The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered
the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
	   The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite
Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death
sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333
to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday.
	   It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
	   The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the
Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
	   ``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign
minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam
Khomeini ... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all
over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
	   Last week, more than half the members of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.
