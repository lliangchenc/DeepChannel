   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ More than 1,000 relief workers from 19
countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of
Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an
outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the
rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily: By
Wednesday night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had
been recovered. More than 16,000 people were listed as seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the death toll could
rise further. He said rescue teams had been unable to reach some
areas because roads are impassable and communications disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament met in special session, and members listened gravely
as the minister of Public Works and Housing, Koray Aydin, described
the extent of the calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing the greatest natural disaster in the history of
the Turkish Republic,'' Aydin said. ``For the first time, we have
had an earthquake that affected the area where 45 percent of the
Turkish population lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign help is especially vital because early rescue efforts by
the Turkish authorities have been plagued by inexperience, poor
organization and lack of supplies. In some stricken towns, newly
arrived foreigners found no organized rescue effort under way and
took charge themselves, directing battalions of eager volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   News commentators pilloried the government for what they said
were inexcusable lapses, both in preparing for an earthquake that
scientists said was sure to come and in dealing with it after it
struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue effort is a fiasco,'' one Istanbul newspaper
asserted. Another said, ``Rescue and relief is coming late or not
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts blamed unscrupulous contractors and ineffective
inspectors for having contributed to the scope of the catastrophe
by allowing the construction of flimsy buildings that could not
withstand a quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inevitable happened, despite years and years of repeated
warnings,'' said Ahmet Ercan, a professor of geophysics at Istanbul
Technical University. ``Officials refused to face facts. They never
insisted that contractors survey the risks and build
earthquake-resistant structures. Maybe after this bitter
experience, we will update our regulations along the lines of
Japan, the United States and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the quake was near Izmit, about 55 miles east
of Istanbul. There, an astonishing number of the destroyed
buildings were new, built within the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Semiha Adiyaman, a plump and vigorous grandmother in her
sixties, lived in an apartment, one of five five-story buildings
perched together on a hilltop just outside of Izmit.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday she stood by possessions that workers had extracted
from the rubble: a pile of clothing, suitcases that did not close,
curtains, a kitchen chair.
</P>
<P>
   Then she clambered over concrete debris to the fringes of the
rock pile that was once her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you should look into,'' she said angrily,
grabbing hold of quarter-inch steel rods jutting out of the
concrete. ``This is too thin and it was done to save money.
Somebody needs to look into this and ask if the buildings were too
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other residents of Izmit posed similar questions,
complaining that contractors had scrimped on the amount of cement
used to bind the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In Darica, a suburb of Izmit, the central shopping area reopened
more or less normally Wednesday. The weekly street markets bustled,
selling everything from fruit to shoes. Yet on the hilltop where
Mrs. Adiyaman lived, perhaps a mile away, three out of five
identical apartment buildings had been flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once
every two years. But most strike the rugged and sparsely populated
eastern provinces. This one hit the country's densely populated
industrial heartland, the region southwest of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighborhoods in Istanbul itself were also damaged, but
Tuesday's quake was not the enormous one that some scientists say
is likely to strike this teeming metropolis sometime in the coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Historic monuments such as the Haghia Sophia, once the seat of
Byzantine power, and Topkapi Palace, from which Ottoman sultans
ruled, were unscathed by Tuesday's powerful quake.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary
magnitude of 7.8, but downgraded that to 7.4, one of the strongest
of the century anywhere in the world. Turkish seismologists put its
strength at 7.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely serious quake, really terrible,'' said a
foreign diplomat who toured the affected area by car and
helicopter. ``You see these huge heaps of rubble and you ask, `How
are they ever going to get anyone out of there?' It's a God-awful
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no new aftershocks on Wednesday, but many Turkish
families in the earthquake zone have nonetheless chosen to remain
in tents or other outdoor shelters for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   With so much effort being made to rescue those who are believed
still alive, there has been little time to assess long-term damage.
But television footage from many towns showed utter destruction
that will certainly cripple Turkey's effort to climb out of the
economic troubles into which it has fallen this year.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Teams of rescue workers arrived steadily at the Istanbul airport
on Wednesday. Officials carrying clipboards wandered through the
arrival lounge asking passengers, ``Are you rescue people?''
</P>
<P>
   Among emergency workers who arrived Wednesday were 70 from the
United States, most of them firefighters who rushed to Izmit, where
the country's largest oil refinery burned through the day as
emergency crews awaited specially equipped French and German planes
that were used to extinguish oil well fires after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every European country sent money, relief workers or
equipment, including Greece, which is Turkey's principal rival in
the eastern Mediterranean. The European Union contributed $2.1
million in emergency aid. Relief planes also arrived from
non-European countries including Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Pakistan
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The largest foreign contributor so far has been Israel, which
dispatched two firefighting planes, teams of dogs trained to track
buried humans, and 350 relief workers, some from specialized
military units that joined the search for survivors after U.S.
embassies in Africa were bombed last year. Israel has also pledged
to send a fully equipped field hospital within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Israel have forged a strong strategic partnership
over the last few years, and Israel is evidently anxious to show
that it can be a good friend when Turkey is in need.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television stations broadcast nearly non-stop coverage
of relief efforts. The most poignant scenes showed victims being
brought out from the wreckage of collapsed buildings. Overwrought
spectators cheered and sobbed each time a survivor was found, and
simply sobbed when bodies, including many of small children, were
seen to be lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   Although Izmit and the nearby town of Adapazari were believed to
have been the hardest hit, another focus of the relief effort is
the port of Golcuk on the Sea of Marmara. The navy base there was
destroyed, and local officials said that 100 others may lie beneath
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey sits atop some of the world's most unstable geology.
Scientists said Tuesday's earthquake was along the Anatolia Fault,
a 100-mile arc that winds beneath northwestern provinces near
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly no surprise,'' said Ahmet Mete Isikara,
director of an observatory in Istanbul and a leading specialist on
earthquake risk. ``There is no technique for predicting
earthquakes, so we couldn't say when it would happen. But we knew
it would, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Anatolia fault zone is quite complex, but certainly the
possibility of an even bigger earthquake, even one in Istanbul, is
still there. Most probably we will get a lot of lessons from this
quake. We have to, otherwise we will suffer the same thing in the
future.''
