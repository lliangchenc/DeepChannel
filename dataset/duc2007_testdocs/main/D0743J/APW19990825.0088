<HEADLINE> Stricter Building Vowed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's prime minister has promised  
stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy 
construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's 
massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor  
reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said 
they still held out hopes -- though slim -- that more people could be 
found alive. The government on Tuesday said the death toll rose to 
17,997, but revised that figure down to 12,514 early today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cinarcik, a suburb of the resort town of Yalova, rescuers  
rushed to the site of a collapsed building after residents reported 
hearing sounds from under the crushed concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Numan Arslanyer, head of the crisis center in Yalova,  
said four brothers were believed buried in the building, and that 
Turkish, Bulgarian and German rescuers were working intensively to 
dig them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not lost hope to find people alive, and we will not  
lose hope,'' he said today. The last live rescue was Monday, when a 
4-year-old boy was saved. 
</P>
<P>
	A new tremor 200 miles away sent residents running into the  
streets in panic Tuesday night. The 4.7-magnitude quake was 
centered near Haymana, 40 miles south of the capital, Ankara. A 
4.2-magnitude aftershock followed. Haymana residents spent the 
night in parks and their cars, fearing more tremors. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more than a week after the quake, counting the dead was  
proving a difficult task. An official at the government's crisis 
center in Ankara, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a 
mistake had been made while entering data into a computer, 
resulting in the erroneous report that nearly 18,000 people had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days of rain have deepened the misery of the estimated  
200,000 people left homeless by the quake, many of whom have 
complained bitterly that the government has been slow in responding 
to the crisis. Turkey's leaders defended their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the people have the right to be nervous, have the  
right to complain, but this is a natural disaster,'' Prime Minister 
Bulent Ecevit said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the buildings that collapsed like houses of cards in the  
quake were built with concrete that had been mixed with ordinary 
sea sand. Rescuers say they have even seen seashells in the 
crumbled concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mistakes have been made in the past with regard to the  
unofficial control of constructions ... and we are determined as a 
government to take the necessary steps,'' said the prime minister, 
without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anatolia news agency today quoted one major building  
contractor as acknowledging he used sea sand in his concrete. He 
said he hadn't understood the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a contractor's license -- I am not a builder,''  
the report quoted contractor Veli Gocer as saying. He said nearly 
one-sixth of the 3,000 apartment units he built had collapsed in 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Veli spoke to Anatolia from in hiding, but told the agency he  
would surrender to police when passions calmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid,  
including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, 
flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and 
garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dutch group said it would send 30,000 prefabricated shelters  
designed to withstand quakes and winter cold. The United States 
plans to send 3,500 all-weather tents, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	International efforts to assess the damage were gathering speed,  
with a European Community delegation arriving today and due to 
visit the quake zone Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarja Halonen, the foreign minister of Finland, was accompanied  
by the EU's external relations commissioner, Hans van den Broek. 
Finland holds the rotating EU presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rescue efforts like the one today in Cinarcik, the  
search for survivors was winding down. But there was a strong 
reluctance to officially declare that there was no longer hope for 
pulling anyone from the rubble alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Out in hard-hit cities like Golcuk and Izmit, heavy earthmoving  
equipment was at work at many sites, marking an effective end to 
the delicate rescue efforts of previous days. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, relief workers were turning their attention to the  
quake's devastating psychological effects. A French group said it 
was beginning counseling for 500 children in quake-damaged Izmit, 
and Turkey's Psychological Association said it would send 50 
therapists to the quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The association was also distributing leaflets meant to help  
people mentally cope with the losses they had suffered.
