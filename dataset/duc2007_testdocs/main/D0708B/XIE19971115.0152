MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Interior and Local
Government Secretary Robert Barbers today called on all local
officials to immediately implement contingency measures to cushion
the effects of El Nino, specially the shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of President Fidel Ramos' call to respond to El
Nino, Barbers said that local government units should lead in the
drive to conserve water and take necessary steps to protect the
country's water resources.
</P>
<P>
"We must immediately put into action practical water
conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and
allows us to recycle water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said local government units can enact ordinances
banning the drawing of water from communal waterworks system for
watering lawns, gardens, campuses, parks and for pressurized car
washes.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local government units to monitor the use of all
public deep wells, fountains, and springs to ensure that the water
from these sources are properly utilized, preferably only for
cooking and for other basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
Industrial users should have their own water sources so as not
to prejudice the water available to the general public or unduly
deplete communal water systems such as rivers and lakes, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Barbers ordered all regional offices under his
department to undertake an information campaign to disseminate
water conservation measures and to explain the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that water shortage brought by the El Nino
weather phenomenon will be very serious in the Philippines. The
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Metro Manila has
announced that it will reduce water supply and the number of hours
of water service.
</P>
<P>
"The lowered levels in our dams and water catchments will
worsen even more unless the weather cycle brings us typhoons,"
Barbers said, adding it is necessary to "do everything possible to
alleviate the adverse effects of the El Nino".
