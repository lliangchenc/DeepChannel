<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Affects Hospital Operation in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Water shortage in Pokhara, a
famous city for tourism in Nepal, is so severe that surgical
operations on patients can not go on smoothly in the Regional
Hospital in the city, according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr. Somat Singh Tulachan
said that as the Drinking Water Corporation in the city was not
able to supply water regularly, the operations on patients often
had to be postponed when water was not available in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes operations were performed by fetching water in
buckets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Singh admitted that lack of water had caused inconvenience to
the patients and the hospital was getting dirty.
</P>
<P>
Some patients complained that they had to bring water from home
for drinking and daily use.
</P>
<P>
And there is no regular supply of water even in the city,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Hospital in Pokhara is the biggest hospital of the
western region in Nepal, with 200 beds and about 500 out-patients
daily.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal is rich in water resources, water shortage is
pervasive in the country because of its inability to tap the
resources and the lack of well-managed supply system. Even in
Kathmandu, the capital of the country, regular water supply can
not be guaranteed.
