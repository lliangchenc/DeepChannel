ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 170,000 children under
one year of age die every year because of the shortage of potable
water in Afghanistan, according to a press report reaching here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that only 23 percent of the Afghan people
benefit form clean water. Almost 50 percent of the diseases posing
a threat to children's lives are caused by the lack of clean water.

"But lack of clean water is not the only problem being faced by
the people of Afghanistan," said the report. "Another problem
which has hit the people is drought."
