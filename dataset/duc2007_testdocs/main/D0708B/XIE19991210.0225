<HEADLINE> Lebanon Suffers Annual Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese official has warned
that his country is suffering an annual water shortage of more
than 1 billion cubic meters, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day seminar on environment and water
resources here on Thursday, Fadi Qmeir, director-general of the
Ministry of Electricity and Water Resources, attributed much of
the shortage to wasted water from leaky pipes in the network.
</P>
<P>
He added that distribution was inefficient, relying too heavily
on pumping systems which bring water from the coast to rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
He argued that dams offered the only means to meet the
country's water needs.
</P>
<P>
"These dams would rely on gravity, causing water to flow from
the hills into valleys," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is studying the feasibility of building 15 dams
and 16 hill ponds to collect rain water during the winter for use
in the dry month of summer.
</P>
<P>
Qmeir said construction on four dams could begin in 2000. He
promised the ministry annual budget of around 40 million
U.S. dollars would cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists argued that while increasing supply will
reduce the water deficit, an efficient water management scheme
is also needed to help meet the demand.
