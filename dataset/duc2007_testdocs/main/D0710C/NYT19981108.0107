   JERUSALEM _ The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on
a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that
immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest
in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious level the arrest of two Israeli men in a small
fishing village near Larnaca, Cyprus, spotlighted increased
regional tensions about the growing security cooperation between
Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Udi Hargov, 27, and Yigal Damary, 49, who claimed
to be teachers, were held on suspicion of espionage after the
Cypriots said they had been found with a complement of electronic
equipment while recording police or military conversations off a
sophisticated scanner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cypriots, the men had visited the coastal
village, Zygi, which abuts a military camp, twice before in the
previous month. The proprietor of a local taverna, Panikos
Cristoldo, had been alerted to notify the authorities if they
returned. When they did, Cristoldo turned them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something in my heart told me these were spies who had come to
hurt my country,'' Cristoldo told the Israeli daily Maariv. ``Since
my intuition never disappoints me, I knew that when the police
turned up, they would not go away empty-handed. Everyone in our
small village suspected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, traveled to Nicosia just last
week to smooth tensions with Cyprus, where the government is wary
of the growing closeness between Israel and Turkey. Cyprus has been
in a tense dispute with Turkey since 1974, when Turkish forces
seized control of the northern third of the island. Tensions have
been aggravated by the Greek Cypriots' recent purchase of Russian
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally we are not happy that holders of Israeli passports
were involved in something like this,'' said Euripides Euriviades,
the Cypriot ambassador to Israel. ``There is a lot of anxiety back
home with what is happening with the ongoing strategic, military
relationship between Israel and Turkey. We had the assurances of
President Weizman last week that no harm could come to us from this
relationship. So the timing of the incident is not great, although
we have due process back home and everyone is innocent until proved
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, Turkey and Israel have forged a close
strategic relationship. The Israelis have sold military equipment
and provided training to the Turks, and the Turks have allowed
Israeli military planes to fly over Turkish air space. Before the
Turkish prime minister visited Israel in early September, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel created a political storm by
saying the relationship constituted a ``new axis'' in the Middle
East. He later retracted this description, saying he had not
expressed himself well.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Ron Ben
Yishai, a security expert, said the highly publicized arrests were
meant to send ``a warning to Israel lest it decide to provide
Turkey with any intelligence or military assistance in its fight
against Greek Cyprus.''
</P>
<P>
   Euriviades said the Cypriots would probably charge the two with
espionage within the week. Spying is punishable by a maximum
sentence of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained unclear Sunday whom _ if anyone _ the two
Israelis represented. Some intelligence experts theorized that they
were working directly for the Turks, who have vowed to block the
imminent delivery of the new surface-to-air missiles. The Cypriots
fear that the Israelis have trained Turkish pilots in sophisticated
interception techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions,
and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two
Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The previous visit had coincided with a Greek-Cypriot military
exercise off the coast, the Cypriot authorities said. The Israelis'
activities raised suspicions, and when they returned, Cypriot
officials obtained a search warrant for their temporary apartment,
and said they had found cameras, maps, two scanners and tapes of
Greek conversations between police or military officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that based on the information that we have,
they came for the purpose of spying on the Republic of Cyprus and
specifically the National Guard,'' Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the
police lawyer for the Larnaca district, told a court.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli press Sunday used the occasion to recount all
Mossad's most recent blunders. They included an incident earlier
this year, when five Mossad agents were caught trying to bug a
house in Bern, Switzerland. That same week, the Mossad director
resigned over a bungled attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in
Jordan last fall.
