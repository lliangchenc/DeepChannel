<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel wants to clarify the issue
about the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on charge of spying,
with the aim of bringing them back home.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israeli TV Channel 2 Sunday night, Netanyahu said
that "every Israeli citizen is important to us. We will clarify
this, and of course we will bring them home."
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landu, Chairman of Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, has also said that they should be brought back
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities are widely said to be underway between
the two sides, because they want the affair to end quietly.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Justice Ministry issued a brief statement Sunday,
saying the two men were not working for Israel. It did not mention
the word "Mossad," Israel's intelligence organization.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jerusalem have declined to comment till now,
except confirming that the two are Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Suspects Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, have been
remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia
for further investigation at an unspecified location, reports from
Cyprus said, adding that the two are being held separately.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has expressed concern over the military alliance between
Turkey and Israel, but is also keen on maintaining good relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time this year that Israel has been
embarrassed by a "security mishap" in Cyprus. In April, two
Israeli planes were caught flying over a planned missile base in
the northwest of the Island.
