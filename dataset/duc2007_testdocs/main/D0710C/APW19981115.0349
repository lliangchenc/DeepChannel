	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of
spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv
just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
	   The court ordered the two held for another five days after the
prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete
investigating ``a very serious case of spying.''
	   He added that investigations have already established that
shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov. 6 the two
men had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose
headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are
agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they
were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port
of Ziyi.
	   Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents. Israel's
Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on
behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. A ministry
statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but
gave no further explanation.
	   Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance Nov. 6
a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports of
suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area.''
	   ``On the night of their arrest there was a very important
military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he
added.
	   Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions
or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
	   Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27,
and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
