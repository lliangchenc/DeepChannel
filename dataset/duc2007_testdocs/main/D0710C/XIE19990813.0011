<HEADLINE> Barak Thanks Cyprus for Pardoning Israeli Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday expressed his appreciation on Cyprus for its
pardoning of two Israelis who had been given jail terms on spy
charges.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Barak's office, the prime minister
said that the act, carried out by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides at the recommendation of the Cypriot general prosecutor,
is greatly appreciated by the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the act will promote the good neighborly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in
southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy
a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region.
</P>
<P>
They had pleaded guilty to a charge of approaching the
prohibited military area and were sentenced to three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
They were also given a concurrent jail term of six months for
possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
</P>
<P>
Israel has admitted the two were agents from its Mossad
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
Their pardons approved by Clerides were "based on the national
interest of Cyprus. The continuing detention of the two men would
no longer serve the national interest," a statement issued by
Cypriot government said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also called it a friendly gesture to
Israeli Barak assuming office last month.
