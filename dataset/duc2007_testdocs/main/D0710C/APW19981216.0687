	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said Wednesday he supports the establishment of a Palestinian
state but urged that no step be taken unilaterally.
	   ``I am for a Palestinian state for the alternative to a
Palestinian state is a poor one,'' he said. But he suggested that
such a move should be negotiated.
	   Peres said his visit had helped dispel bad feelings between
Cyprus and Israel following last month's arrest on the island of
two Israelis on suspicion of spying.
	   Peres said he had ``very, very friendly talks'' with President
Glafcos Clerides, ``and I think all the problems were clarified.''
	   He added that the mission of the two Israelis who have been
described as Mossad agents ``was basically a mistake.''
	   The two Israelis were arrested on Nov. 6 and are to go on trial
for spying and gathering military information on Dec. 21.
	   Peres avoided revealing the nature of the two Israelis' mission
but indicated it was linked to anti-terrorism.
	   ``It wasn't bad intentions or any attempt to spy on Cyprus or
against Cyprus. This is nonsense. It is a local accident which we
regret very much,'' he added.
