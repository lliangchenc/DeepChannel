Report: Group allegedly spying for Israel arrested

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ More than 20 people, including a woman,
have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, a Beirut
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Ad Diyar newspaper said the arrests followed a security sweep
carried out by the Lebanese army in the neighborhood of Chiyeh in
Beirut's southern suburbs in the past few days.
	   The suspects were providing a Cyprus-based branch of the Israeli
intelligence service, Mossad, with information, the paper said,
quoting unidentified ``informed sources.''
	   It did not say what kind of information the suspects allegedly
gave to Mossad.
	   The network was uncovered based on information from a Lebanese
suspected of being a spy for Israel and of helping Israeli troops
in the assassination of a guerrilla leader in south Lebanon last
month, the paper said.
	   Hossam al-Amin, a commander of the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal
guerrilla movement, was killed when a missile fired from an Israeli
attack helicopter struck his car in south Lebanon.
	   The paper's report could not immediately be confirmed by
security officials. The latest arrests were believed to be separate
from a spy ring that the government said it uncovered on July 8.
	   Then, Lebanon accused 77 people of passing information to Israel
on Lebanese and Syrian troop movements and the activities of
Lebanese guerrillas. At the time, officials said 17 of the suspects
were under arrest and the remaining 60 were at large.
	   Government Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud said the 77 faced charges for
``the crimes of contacting the Israeli enemy and its agents'' and
passing information to them. If convicted, the suspects could face
the death penalty.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids
contacts with the Jewish state.
