	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on
suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot
government said Sunday.
	   ``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to
link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot
Justice Ministry said Sunday.
	   There were no other details. A Cypriot police source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.
	   The two Israelis were arrested Saturday in a small community of
Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca. Cypriot police
said they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of
conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the
apartment the two were renting.
	   The two Israelis were visited Saturday and Sunday by Israeli
consulate officials.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben
Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the
arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with
Turkey in any spy operation.
	   Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's
presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb
the missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go
ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, speculated that the two
suspects might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
	   Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a
military training exercise in the area.
	   Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent
months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as
part of their 1996 defense pact. Israel has repeatedly insisted
that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other
countries in the region.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching
up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last
week.
	   Cypriot ambassador to Israel Euripides Evriades told Israel's
Channel Two TV that he hoped the incident would not harm relations
between the two countries.
	   ``We want to look at this through the prism of the good
relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these
relations,'' Evriades said.
	   During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional
listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.
