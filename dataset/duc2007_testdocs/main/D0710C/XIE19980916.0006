<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Alliance Not to Harm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus
that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and
urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting Tuesday with Cyprus' House of
Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou, Israeli Ambassador to
Nicosia Shemi Tzur said his country wants stability in the
Eastern Mediterranean and would like to see a solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Tzur made the remarks just one day after Arab ambassadors
accredited to Cyprus expressed concern about Israeli-Turkish
military alliance following their meeting with Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements made Monday by Arab ambassadors to
Cyprus that they are worried over the Turkish-Israeli military
alliance, Tzur said that "Arab countries should be more worried
how to proceed with the peace process with Israel and to leave
this sort of things aside."
</P>
<P>
He said their worries have nothing to do with Cyprus and urged
Arab diplomats to help "promote peace process with Israel, to
convince Palestinians... to come forward to proceed with the
peace."
</P>
<P>
Tzur said that during his meeting with Kyprianou, the Cypriot
House president received again the assurances that Israel's
cooperation with Turkey has nothing in it to harm Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus,
there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus," Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996
when they signed a military cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said his country "is looking for stability in the Eastern
Mediterranean, we want to see stability, we want to see the Cyprus
problem being solved."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kyprianou said that during his discussions with
the Israeli ambassador, he raised the issue of the military
cooperation between Israel and Turkey because "it creates an
atmosphere of concern to both Cyprus and Greece and to other
countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said Tzur told him that the alliance is of a technical and
commercial nature and has nothing to do with Cyprus, nor should
it affect the very good relations between the two countries or
the relations between Israel and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between
countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect
issues which seriously concern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since the
opening of its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the
exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.
