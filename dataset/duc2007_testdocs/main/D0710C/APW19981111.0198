Israel: Spies weren't working on Turkey's behalf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's
Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
	   The statement did not say who had employed the two.
	   ``The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act
against Cyprus and didn't act on Turkey's behalf,'' the statement
said.
	   The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus,
which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact
with Turkey. Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis
were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the
northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   But the Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain good
relations with the island country.
	   ``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed
recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue
and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it would continue to clarify the
issue.
