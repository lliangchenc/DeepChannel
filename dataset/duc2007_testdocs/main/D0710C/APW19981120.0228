Paper: Cyprus watched suspected spies from the start

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to
the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a
Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
	   Haaretz, citing a Cypriot source, said the two Israelis now in
police custody in Nicosia were under surveillance during a previous
visit to Cyprus in mid-October, but were allowed to leave because
of a lack of incriminating evidence.
	   On their next trip in early November, Cyprus monitored the two
Israelis as soon as they arrived at Larnaca airport on forged
passports, the paper said.
	   The surveillance led to their Nov. 6 arrest in the coastal
fishing village of Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and
recording devices in their rented apartment.
	   Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said the two had been
telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters
is in Tel Aviv'' shortly before the arrest, Haaretz said.
	   Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of
Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
	   Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an
intelligence operation near Ziyi.
	   A statement released this week by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's office was interpreted by Israeli media as a
confirmation that two worked for Israel's Mossad. There was no
indication from the statement that the two men could have worked
independently of the government.
	   Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men
in custody are Mossad agents. Israel's Foreign Ministry has said
only that reports that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey were
not true. A ministry statement added that the two were not acting
against Cyprus, but gave no further explanation.
	   The source cited by Haaretz said that the two men refuse to
cooperate with interrogators.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974,
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
