   &UR; COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can you smooth wrinkles with Chinese therapy? As a healing
technique, acupuncture boasts an impressive track record.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting tiny needles into various areas of the body,
practitioners of this Chinese therapy have shown the value of
acupuncture in relieving pain, easing nausea and lowering blood
pressure. Now, acupuncturists say that their services can also
erase signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic acupuncture works in a variety of ways, says licensed
acupuncturist and traditional-Chinese-medicine practitioner Phyllis
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting a needle into the skin causes oxygenated,
nutrient-rich blood to rush to that spot. This promotes circulation
and healing. Second, facial muscles relax during the treatment,
Olson says, which lessens the appearance of wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists believe that the body's energy, or chi, takes
certain pathways. By using needles to access points on those
pathways, an acupuncturist can move the energy where it's needed to
speed healing or eliminate damage.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no scientific evidence to back up these claims,
cosmetic acupuncture may have some benefits, says Dr. Barney Kenet,
a dermatologic surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to the sun, contraction of facial muscles is the major
cause of wrinkling. That's why we get smile lines and
crow's-feet,'' Kenet says. ``If acupuncture relaxes the muscles, it
might reduce wrinkling temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the increased blood flow, at most it will probably give
you a temporary rosy complexion _ something you don't want if you
have an inflammatory condition such as acne or rosacea. Otherwise,
cosmetic acupuncture is relatively harmless.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in trying it, keep expectations in check
and enjoy the experience. Aside from the momentary stings,
acupuncture is really quite relaxing, Olson says.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment _ depending on the amount of wrinkles _ consists
of about 20 to 25 superfine needles being inserted into the face,
ear or hand. The price runs from $60 to $100 per session.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of results can you expect? Improvement after the first
treatment can last about a week. After 10 weekly sessions, the
body's energy will begin moving into these areas on its own.
Monthly treatments can maintain the results, Olson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GENTLER AND MORE ACCURATE HEART TEST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a study of patients recovering from a first heart attack,
myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) plus a drug that increases blood
flow to the heart predicted future heart attacks better than the
standard exercise-stress test. The technique can be performed 48
hours after a heart attack, compared with a five-to-seven-day
waiting period for the stress test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's danger of a second cardiac event, this can enable
physicians to make lifesaving treatment decisions earlier,'' says
Dr. Kenneth A. Brown, author of the study and director of the
nuclear-cardiology and cardiac-stress laboratories at the
University of Vermont in Burlington, where the study was conducted.
MPI is available at most large and medium-size hospitals.

   &UR; NOSE DROPS EASE MIGRAINE PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lidocaine nose drops, available by prescription, may offer the
fastest relief from a migraine headache. In a study at the Southern
California Permanente Medical Group in Woodland Hills, researchers
found that the medication eased pain within 15 minutes for 36
percent of patients, compared to 7 percent of those given a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up study found that the treatment brought relief within
30 minutes to more than half of the migraine sufferers who tried
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best candidates for lidocaine are those who have
occasional migraines,'' says Dr. Morris Maizels, lead study author
and a family-practice doctor at Permanente. If you experience
symptoms before the migraine itself, Maizels advises, ``a quick
lidocaine treatment may prevent the pain from setting in at all.'' &QL;
