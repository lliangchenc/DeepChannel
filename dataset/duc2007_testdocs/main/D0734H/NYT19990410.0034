   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Acupuncture, therapeutic massage, herbal
therapies and yoga: Have these alternative therapies earned their
place in mainstream American medicine?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Weil, arguing for their acceptance, and Dr. Arnold
Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical
treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate
Friday night at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative
medicine, sparred on most points with Relman, editor and chief
emeritus at the New England School of Medicine, who is squarely
from the mainstream medical community.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote
in the ``New'' ``Republic,'' in which he referred to Weil's methods
as preposterous. At the debate, he said Weil's therapies are
``based on wildly implausible theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment
that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   With 42 percent of the public now using some sort of alternative
medical therapies, Weil and others have been pushing the nation's
medical schools to start requiring more medical students to learn
more about such things as acupuncture, herbal therapies and
hundreds of other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Relman was appalled by that idea that medical students should be
taught alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching medical students how to do alternative therapies would
overthrow what medical schools teach, Relman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believe first,'' he said to Weil. ``Then you try it. Maybe
it will work. We tell medical students to look for the data. To
look for objective evidence is how you train doctors to be
trustworthy or reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we bring it into the medical mainstream when
evidence is scant? It is based on unproven therapies, contrary to
all that 20th-century medicine . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a time of breakthroughs and this won't help us make
those advances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weil disagreed, saying that powerful social and economic
forces moving now are going to make alternative medicine even more
widely used and it would be better to have doctors trained than to
just let it happen haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, we may have HMOs deciding what type of
massage therapy is good.
</P>
<P>
   More corporations are also interested in health plans that
include alternative therapies but don't know how to sort out what
works and what is cost-effective, Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the future not only because patients want it, but
practitioners do, too, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical students want to know why they aren't learning about
herbal therapies,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Relman replied that the reason more doctors and medical students
are interested in it is that medical care is being delivered like a
business. They are unhappy spending less time with patients and may
be looking for a different livelihood themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of what may be many discussions in the future
that could affect every person's health, and the two participants
hope to take the debate to other college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Relman's comment that sorting out what to teach
from all the various alternative therapies would be impossible,
Weil said he found his answer on a button that someone sent him:
``Those who say it can't be done should get of the way of people
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both spoke strongly Friday on their positions, said Dr. Chris
Shearer, residency director at Phoenix Baptist Hospital and
president of the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One winner in this debate _ that there needs to be more
research about alternative therapies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, although many say not enough considering the huge
growing interest in alternative medicines. The National Institutes
of Health is spending $40 million to $50 million on research on
alternative therapies this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Relman's responses were defined by traditional medicine,''
said Carol Feingold, faculty member of the UA College of Nursing.
``But I think people want more than that, they don't just want
treatment of disease. They want health care, but they want the
whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Bourke, chairman of National Integrative Medicine, a
health care business in the Valley, said, ``Patients today are
looking to physicians for answers and aren't getting them. Doctors
don't have the training or the time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of different terms used when people describe
alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that most of those using alternative medicine
are women, and about 86 percent have at least some college, said
Rena Gordon, a medical geographer affiliated with both the
University of Arizona and Arizona State University. They are
middle-age and socially established. Many of them live in the West.
</P>
<P>
   They use alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional
medicine, she said. Only 4 percent use alternative medicine
exclusively but disclosure is low. No one knows how many people go
to alternative healers because they don't talk about it, especially
with their family physician.
</P>
<P>
   Because Weil's clinic at UA is a teaching clinic, it is unable
to accommodate large numbers of patients. There is a waiting list
of several hundred and at least several months to be seen. The
clinic is set up as a self-pay program because most HMOs don't
reimburse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, individuals interested in a place on the waiting
list may call 1-(520)-694-6555. &QL;
