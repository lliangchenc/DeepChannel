<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Endorse Acupuncture Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. medical expert
committee today endorsed Chinese traditional needle therapy
acupuncture as part of the mainstream American medicine.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member committee selected by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) said that "clear evidence" has been found that
acupuncture effectively treats pain after surgery or dental
procedures and controls nausea and vomiting caused by cancer
chemotherapy or pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The committee also said in a report that acupuncture also is
effective in some patients for tennis elbow, muscle pain and
menstrual cramps.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time there is a public statement from the Health
and Human Services that acupuncture might have a role in treating
certain health problems," said Dr. Helga Well-Apelt, a medical
doctor who uses Chinese medicine in her practice.
</P>
<P>
"It can now be called real medicine," said Dr. Bradley J.
Williams, president of the American Academy of Medical
Acupuncture, an organization of about 3,000 doctors certified to
perform acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
With a history of more than 2,000 years, acupuncture is a major
part of an Asian tradition of medicine. The practice of the
therapy involves sticking thin, sharpened needles into specific
nerve junction points on the body. The needles often are rotated
or electrically stimulated.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in
the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation
only after late U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in
1972.
