Most U.S. medical schools now teaching alternative therapies

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical
schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic,
acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey
found.
	   With millions of Americans visiting alternative practitioners
yearly, educators whose job is to prepare doctors of the future
have no choice but to ``respond to this relentless challenge to
evolve,'' researchers said.
	   The survey of the nation's 125 medical schools was published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   The survey, conducted last fall, found that 75 of the 117
responding schools offered elective courses in alternative medicine
or included those topics in required courses. Less than two years
before, an AMA poll of the same schools found that only 46 were
teaching such topics.
	   ``That's an extraordinary rise for a very traditional and
conservative area,'' said lead author Miriam S. Wetzel, a
curriculum coordinator at Harvard Medical School.
	   ``Now, these things are being taught in Western medical schools,
not necessarily the techniques of how to do them, but certainly
about them.''
	   Dr. David Spiegel, medical director of the Complementary
Medicine Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center, said he was
not surprised by the survey's findings.
	   ``There has been sort of a sea change,'' he said. ``Traditional
doctors are seeing that people are voting with their feet and with
their pocketbooks.''
	   A 1993 survey suggested that Americans spent dlrs 14 billion
yearly on alternative care, much of it out of their own pockets.
	   Health insurers in the past have refused to pay for alternative
therapies, but that also is changing as insurers realize they can
save money.
	   For example, unconventional treatment might call for exercise or
chiropractic or acupuncture for back pain, while the traditional
approach might be surgery.
