<HEADLINE> Acupuncture May Help Cocaine Addicts  </HEADLINE>

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Acupuncture is an effective treatment
for those addicted to cocaine, Yale researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine
reports that patients who received therapeutic acupuncture
treatments, along with counseling, were more likely to have
cocaine-negative tests than those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study shows that that alternative therapies can be
combined with the arsenal of Western treatments for fighting
addiction,'' said Yale Medical School researcher Arthur Margolin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the patients studied, 53.8 percent of those receiving the
acupuncture technique tested free of cocaine during the last week
of the treatment, compared with 23.5 percent and 9.1 percent in the
two control groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those who completed the acupuncture treatment also had longer
periods of sustained abstinence than participants in either control
group.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-week study involved 82 participants who were addicted
to heroin and cocaine. They received methadone for their heroin
addiction, but no medication for their cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   All participants received individual and group counseling. They
were divided into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   One group received auricular acupuncture, in which needles are
inserted into specific places in the outer ear thought to be
associated with addiction.
</P>
<P>
   A second control group received acupuncture in other points
along the outer ear believed to have no treatment effect.
</P>
<P>
   The third group was shown videotapes depicting relaxing images,
such as nature scenes.
</P>
<P>
   While the scientific basis for acupuncture is unknown, the
results are indisputable, said Daniel Iead, clinical coordinator
for the Grant Street Partnership, a New Haven addiction services
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been doing it here for years and it works,'' said Iead.
''The results are fantastic. Some of our most difficult cases have
turned their lives around because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolin said the findings also were encouraging because
acupuncture has fewer side effects and is relatively low-cost. He
said the results suggest the need for increased study of
acupuncture and other forms of alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Controlled clinical research of acupuncture is in its infancy,
and while our positive findings are gratifying, further research is
needed to replicate the results and to better understand how to
combine acupuncture with existing treatments for addiction,''
Margolin said.
