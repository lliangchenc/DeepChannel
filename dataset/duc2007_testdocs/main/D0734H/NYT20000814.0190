   Cocaine addicts looking to get clean may want to turn to needles
for help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is
an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the
ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine,
experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study
from a major American medical school. A report on the finding
appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the work might be the first large, controlled trial of
acupuncture for cocaine addiction, it's not the first time anyone
has used the treatment for substance abuse. Indeed, some 1,000
clinics worldwide offer the needle therapy for the symptoms of
cocaine withdrawal, including nearly 175 in New York state alone,
says Dr. Michael Smith, a pioneer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Cornell University psychiatrist who has been practicing
acupuncture at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for nearly two
decades, calls the Yale research ``a very well-documented report
with high standards that shows that acupuncture helps reduce the
craving for cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Yale psychologist Arthur Margolin, looked at
the effectiveness of acupuncture in 82 heroin and cocaine addicts
who were getting methadone for the first habit but nothing for the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Margolin and his colleagues split the subjects into three
groups. The first received eight weeks of standard addiction
acupuncture therapy, based on guidelines from the National
Acupuncture Detoxification Association, which calls for three to
five needles placed at specific points in the outer ear. The second
group had sham needles placed in non-therapeutic sites on the ear.
The third group watched relaxing videos.
</P>
<P>
   Urine tests for cocaine were taken three times a week over the
trial's two-month period, during which all patients received
counseling and group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   By the last week of the trial, nearly 54 percent of the patients
in the acupuncture group had cocaine-free urine, compared with 23
percent of those in the sham needle group and only 9 percent of
those who watched videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a highly active placebo arm and we still found an
effect over and above that,'' says Margolin, who notes that the
effect of acupuncture was as good as that from drug treatment for
cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS STILL A MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
   While the latest work suggests that acupuncture helps control
cravings for cocaine, it doesn't say anything about why it
succeeds. ``Quite honestly, we don't know why it works,'' Margolin
says. ``We're just beginning to look in Western terms'' at the
biological mechanism behind acupuncture's effect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, says tests show that the needles, if properly
placed, restore balance to the body's electrical currents.
``Acupuncture helps the body help itself.'' Still, he admits, no
one really understands the full mechanics of this assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Margolin and Smith agree that acupuncture
alone isn't a sufficient treatment for addiction, be it to cocaine,
alcohol, tobacco or other substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a treatment that helps a person participate in all the
other treatments we have,'' such as counseling and group therapy,
Smith says. In fact, by law, ear acupuncture for addicts can only
be performed in the context of a licensed drug-treatment program
that includes these other methods, he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, acupuncture does have a key advantage over counseling,
Smith says. If addicts refuse to acknowledge their drug cravings,
therapists have little recourse to treat them. But with
acupuncture, he says, addicts can get treated without losing face.
``You can treat a problem that the patient doesn't admit to.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Mitchell, a licensed acupuncturist and executive
director of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alliance in
Olalla, Wash., says the Yale research lends an extra measure of
credibility to the practice. On the other hand, Mitchell says, with
an estimated 15,000 licensed acupuncturists in the United States
already, the field is well on its way to becoming mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies now reimburse for the treatment, which
got a major shot in the arm in 1997 when the National Institutes of
Health held a consensus conference to discuss the scientific
validity of needle therapy. That report found that acupuncture
helped control pain from dental procedures, menstruation and other
conditions, with fewer side effects than conventional remedies,
Mitchell says.
