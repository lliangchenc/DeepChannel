   NEW YORK _ The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said
it all. Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected
to, and then he had taken even more.
</P>
<P>
   Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet. Then came abandonment
on the beaches of Brooklyn. Mercy arrived in the form of a new
owner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but when he was 8, Al's
back gave out. Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he
still wasn't the dog he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a
pilgrimage of stubborn hope. There, in a back yard in Murray Hill,
Al dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water
that might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower
essences had not: heal him.
</P>
<P>
   With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding
tight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his
gimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise
they sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he
left the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to get well,'' she said, articulating the simple
wish that had wrought such complicated ministrations. ``I want him
to have a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has
ushered in a whole new era in animal care. Ms. Richard's business,
Bonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is
but one example.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking
dogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with
homeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets
beneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with
lavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture
blissed out on St. John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil. It is
also the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many
Americans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances,
from summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal
Medical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of
cross-species psychological transference. ``We project our
character flaws on our pets,'' he said. ``We project our behavior
on them. I've even had clients project their religion on them. This
is very much in the same fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Could your cat benefit from an adjustment? There are a growing
number of veterinary chiropractors on hand. Is there knotting in
your dog's muscles? You can take him to a canine massage therapist.
If it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not
just on the most common species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has
performed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones. Dr. Marcie
Fallek, who has offices in New York and Fairfield, Conn., has
administered homeopathic treatments _ solutions with minuscule
traces of special plant or mineral ingredients _ to a pet raccoon
that was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and
had stopped using its litter box.
</P>
<P>
   The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities
would learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be
interviewed for this article, even anonymously, Fallek said. ``Her
psychic told her there might be trouble,'' Fallek explained.
``Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure
quackery? As it turns out, less than one might think.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary
Medical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at
least on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was
beyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower
essences and the like. ``That's really getting on the fringe,'' he
said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such
treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians
and their clients. ``The world is made up of a lot of very
vulnerable and gullible people,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes
to the vim and vigor of their hirsute _ or, for that matter,
feathered _ loved ones. According to the association, expenditures
by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and
birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied,
from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for
inflation). During that period, the pet population grew only
modestly.
</P>
<P>
   The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of
alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not
cheap. In New York City _ where, granted, prices for most things
tend to be highest _ half an hour of acupuncture generally costs
$50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing
waters costs $75. Because treatments are usually repeated over the
course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than
just random experimentation more than two decades ago. Racehorses
were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes
surrounding the health of these animals were highest.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the field has really taken off,
drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either
integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary
practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.
</P>
<P>
   The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was
founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians. The
International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974,
reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is
still a small fraction of all veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary
acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being
ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats,
dogs and parrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles _ well,
not the shell,'' Ms. Watkins said. ``I know a guy in San Diego who
is doing a dolphin.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to
alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product
catalogs, many with their own Internet sites. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalog provides a
link to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses,
including the ``Broodmare Blend,'' the ``Clear Thinking Blend,''
the ``Ego Builder Blend'' and the ``Mellow Out Blend.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pets being given alternative treatments are often
following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw
how well it worked for Lola,'' Liz Santander, an interior designer
from Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog
awaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of
Dr. Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   It was a busy, busy day. While Lola, who was bouncing back from
a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame
shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.
</P>
<P>
   A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially
paralyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan,
straps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees.
(``I have to throw the Frisbee right at him,'' O'Sullivan
explained.)
</P>
<P>
   But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage
therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a
particularly intimate, thorough petting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel for the bony landmarks,'' Ms. Cooper instructed
O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in
Chinatown. ``Push away from the spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an
acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with
kidney problems. For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn;
then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin
cushion. Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms. Richard's
patients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy,
invisible treadmill. Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with
Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about
35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for
running.
</P>
<P>
   Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu
recovering from surgery for a ruptured disc. The operation had left
Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully
regain.
</P>
<P>
   This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked _ as
far as these things can be determined _ appalled and terrified
about taking the plunge. ``He's a good boy,'' Lauran Walk, his
owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the
surface. ``He's a good, good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village,
said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that
Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and
would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was
only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a
chance,'' Ms. Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a
shivering knot of fur with limited mobility. ``I can't be
selfish.''
