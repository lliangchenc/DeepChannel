BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientifically-based treatments
will open the world market wider to traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM), a national conference in Beijing was told today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, director of the State Bureau of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (SBTCM) told the conference on TCM that the SBTCM
plans to choose five prescriptions of Chinese traditional medicine
with good curative effects, which can meet the demands of the
world market. The aim is to develop them within the next five
years to meet world criteria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bureau will conduct a quality standard study
of 80 kinds of commonly-used TCM in a bid to build up a
world-recognized standards system for traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traditional medicine has become more popular in world
markets in recent years due to few side-effects. But China's
export volume of TCM is only about 500 million US dollars a year,
a very small share in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion enjoy a legal
status in medical treatment in many developed countries due to
efforts by Chinese scientist. They have also explained why
acupuncture can kill pain, with extensive publicity helping make
acupuncture popular in the world.
