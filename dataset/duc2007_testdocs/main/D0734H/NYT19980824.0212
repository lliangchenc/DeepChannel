<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A patch on Art Soto's abdomen continuously
releases a morphine-like drug into his system to lessen the
discomfort from his long battle with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But once a week, Soto also avails himself of a much different
painkiller: acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   As the needles are gently inserted and twisted into his legs,
Soto says he feels more energized, and the throbbing and numbing
begins to subside.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, especially for pain management, is becoming more
common. Health maintenance organizations are starting to pay for
the ancient Chinese therapy, and last week the California
Legislature sent the governor a bill requiring workers'
compensation policies to cover it. Many already do.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, doctors are seeing more patients whose regimens
include treatments such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which
Soto also takes. The issue has become more pressing for mainstream
medicine since the National Institutes of Health last year gave
acupuncture a qualified endorsement for treating post-operative and
dental pain, nausea from chemotherapy, and morning sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Sterling, who is Soto's acupuncturist, said the walls
between western and alternative medicine are starting to come down.
She now talks with the doctors of some of her patients about their
care. And the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine,
where she is a dean, is in the midst of discussions with the Kaiser
Permanente health maintenance organization and the University of
California at San Francisco about joint efforts that could bring
the two approaches closer together, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, medical centers and senior centers are also seeking
to explore possible relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is definitely going to this _ quote _ integrative
care,'' Sterling said. ``It means more patients and more revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser spokeswoman Lila Petersen said the HMO does offer
acupuncture in its chronic pain management program to patients
referred by their primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, our patients are asking for alternative health
care methods, so we are working to provide those services,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the treatments are controversial in some quarters, and
its underlying mechanisms remain a mystery to western medicine.
Sterling said the therapies work by manipulating the patient's life
energy, or ``qi'' (pronounced ``chi'').
</P>
<P>
   In an exam room at the American College of Traditional Chinese
Medicine's Potrero Hill clinic, Sterling begins Soto's treatment by
asking about his health during the past week. He undresses, and
Sterling runs her hands down his legs, where Soto has complained of
pain. When he responds to her touch, she calls out ``Liver 8'' or
``Spleen 1'' _ points on his ``channels'' that are blocked.
</P>
<P>
   She explains that the channels lose their ``moisture'' because
of the HIV infection and as a result the energy is obstructed,
causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sterling and an assistant insert and twirl half a
dozen needles into specific locations on Soto's legs and feet.
Sterling says she can feel the needle interact with the qi, ``like
a fish on a hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the needles are then attached to a device that sends out
an electrical current. A few minutes later, Sterling uses an
acupressure technique on Soto's chest and forehead, and then a
cigar-like stick of herbs is lighted and passed back and forth over
his abdomen, which is supposed to help ease his stomach problems,
caused by taking more than 30 pills a day to control AIDS. All of
this happens while gentle guitar music overlaid on the sounds of
the ocean play on a cassette player nearby.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the theory and the practice seem fuzzy, and skeptics
chalk up the many patient testimonials to the placebo effect. The
National Council Against Health Fraud's position paper on
acupuncture says it remains unproven and its ``theory and practice
are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease
that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some studies have shown that there are physiological
changes _ including the release of the body's own natural
painkillers, endorphins _ during treatment, suggesting there may be
something more at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more insurance companies are saying, `Gee, there
might be some literature to support this, so let's have it as a
covered benefit,''' said Ellen Hughes, interim director of the
Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The university has begun a research study with breast cancer
patients to look at the benefits of acupuncture in treating the
side effects of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful scientific minds are looking at the data, and there's
more of it,'' Hughes said. ``It's going to be more mainstream.''
