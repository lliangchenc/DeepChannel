   TAKE-BOS  
 PALO ALTO, Calif.: ... used to her.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most everything about her is geared toward cycling. Hence the
minimalist lifestyle that most would consider quirky but Freedman
regards as imperative. Oh, sure, she'll share in the inevitable
laughter when people get a gander at her immobile home in the
driveway _ decorated garishly along the sides and windows with
large fruit and other Odwalla insignia. She'll good-naturedly point
out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller
nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem
that meant the engine couldn't be restarted once it was turned off.
And, though she's now the van lord rather than the resident, she'll
chuckle through a guided tour of the interior, featuring a spartan
bed on which she's placed a futon; a cabinet console that houses an
assortment of nutritional supplements _ ``I think I take more pills
than my 80-year-old grandmother''; the guest room, also known as
the passenger seat; the laundry room, formerly the driver's seat;
and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of
cycling tomes and works ranging from ``Schindler's List'' to Jackie
Joyner-Kersee's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   She's lighthearted about the whole thing, but it's no joke. She
lives this way because she believes it facilitates her cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman prefers New England and intends to settle there,
probably in Western Massachusetts, ``because it's more rural. The
people are more family-oriented. They may lack some of the social
graces, but you can know what they're really thinking. You can know
your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, she stays here, living under dorm-like conditions
in _ and outside _ an obscenely overpriced ramshackle ranch that is
a glorified tract house but still rents for $2,875 monthly, this
being Silicon Valley and all. ``Ask people why they're here and
they say to live for a couple of years and make lots of money,''
says Freedman. ``For them, it's get-rich-quick. I guess for me,
it's get-poor-slow.''
</P>
<P>
   So she sacrifices by subletting, enabling her to share indoor
privileges with four fellow transients in a house that is decorated
in what best could be described as collegiate dishabille, the major
furniture being five bikes hanging from a wall in the foyer. ``It's
a cardboard box,'' says Freedman. But it's worth it because she
considers the training conditions here perfect _ the moderate
year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on
which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every
leaf and rock,'' says her father.
</P>
<P>
   Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the
Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind. She needs her sleep,
Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the
driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the
shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unused in the nine-room, four-bedroom family home in
Wellesley is Freedman's room. There a papier-mache monkey that took
her a half-year to create in high school still dangles on a
makeshift branch from a window, a la Curious George. But Freedman
eschews these familiar niceties and the career track many of her
friends _ now doctors and lawyers and teachers _ have followed. She
works part time for an on-line women's sports company but is on
hiatus now as she devotes all her energies to Olympic preparations.
And she hopes never to have a cursed 9-to-5 desk job, preferring to
settle into a career connected with women's sports that will enable
her to get out and about. In the meantime, she follows a trail that
almost defies orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think she enjoys the underdog role,'' says
Schwab. ``It's because of the way she lives. She could live where
the cost of living is lower, work full time, train less . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And hate every minute of it. For better or worse, this is
Freedman's unique interpretation of the American dream. And even
while her parents _ who thought she would proceed directly from
college into a career _ cautiously wonder when, if ever, she'll use
that bachelor's degree in the marketplace, they applaud her
resolve. ``I kind of admire the way she lives,'' says her mother.
``It makes sense to me to pursue what you enjoy doing, not spend
your money on frivolous things but on what gives you enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Marvin and Corey Freedman never envisioned such
all-encompassing enjoyment coming from this.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even when she became an itinerant track apprentice with the
Wayfarers, her parents thought sports were a diversion. ``She's the
only one in the family who's competitive,'' says Marvin. And Corey
adds, ``We didn't realize she was this competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, little did they know. ``We'd go on bike rides to Walden
Pond,'' says Dr. Julie Damon, a Freedman friend since sixth grade.
``She always said she wanted to go to the Olympics, but she never
specified in what event.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not cycling. At least not on the surface. But there
were hints . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell track wasn't a love for her,'' says Peggy
Kriss, who used to employ Freedman as a baby sitter and will
accompany her husband, Cliff Pollan, to Sydney for the road race.
``When she started biking, you knew it was a passion for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, track, if anything, seemed her athletic destiny. Sally
Jean Alexander would write accounts of Wayfarers races for various
local newspapers, and Nicole took great pleasure in the publicity.
``She always enjoyed the limelight,'' says her mother. ``She liked
seeing her name in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``she was competitive in a good way,'' says Dr. Amy
Spooner, who has known Freedman since second grade. ``And she
basically was good at everything she tried.''
</P>
<P>
   That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the
track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to
the 2-mile, and played tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,''
says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh. ``What I found
special about her was her toughness. She was dynamic, a great kid
with a great sense of humor. She's the reason people go into
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and
played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular
activities as Freedman focused on her studies. ``If I did what I'm
best at,'' she says, ``I'd be a mechanical engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her. For one thing,
she wanted to pursue liberal arts. For another, she wanted a more
intensive athletic challenge. ``She found MIT boring,'' says
Spooner. ``I think she wanted to be with people who were more
serious about track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But once there, Freedman took a major detour, and not just
academically. At the Division 1 level in track, ``I was thoroughly
mediocre,'' says Freedman. ``If I fell dead on the track, it
wouldn't matter'' to the team.
</P>
<P>
   So after her junior year, she tried another approach. ``I
decided to do what I wanted to do,'' says Freedman. ``If I felt
like running, I'd run.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week of this new regime, she felt like running 40
miles. ``I said to myself, `See? That proves I'm a runner,' '' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Then she promptly proved she wasn't. ``I didn't do any after
that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her footwork involved pedals. And passion. ``I found
myself riding 200 miles a week,'' says Freedman. ``I did it with
absolutely no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Or thoughts about any riding other than recreational. But Art
Walker, coach of the Stanford club team _ it's not an
NCAA-sanctioned sport _ persuaded her to try competition. And thus
was born an obsession. Freedman helped Stanford win the informal
national college championship, then participated in the Ride Across
America. And she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents discovered her addiction almost by accident. When
they visited Corey's relatives in Los Angeles, Nicole joined them _
by bike. Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus. And on excursions
to the beach during their stay, Nicole would ride while they would
drive. She'd start out earlier, and she'd always be there to meet
them when they arrived, having covered a route that included uphill
ascents even Corey considered taxing _ and she was in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw how Nicole had gone over the mountains,'' says
Corey, ``I was amazed. I wasn't surprised when she won the trials
because what she does is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nicole is living for the ultimate moment _ the Olympic race,
where she'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly
be an amazing acccomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risk and reward,'' says Miller. ``She'll have a go at it.
It may pay off or she may finish last.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, she'll embody the ultimate contradiction in her
life. ``I think there's something about this competitiveness,''
says Marvin Freedman as he attempts to explain his daughter's
decisions to a visitor and to himself. ``You get instant
gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're long-suffering enough, as Nicole Freedman is.
