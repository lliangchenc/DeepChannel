   ``I Know This Much Is True''
</P>
<P>
   By Wally Lamb
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, 897 pages, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHOR: Meet Wally Lamb, a literary cross between John
Grisham and Pat Conroy. He's like Grisham because of his singular
knack for telling a story; like Conroy for his writing talent, the
pithy one-liners sprinkled throughout the book, and a penchant for
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey discovered Lamb some time after he published his
first book, ``She's Come Undone,'' which became a monster
bestseller. ``I Know This Much Is True'' shot to No. 1 on the
bestseller lists soon after Lamb's recent appearance on Oprah's
show. But it didn't stay there long. The book's daunting length is
probably why.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT: Narrator Dominick Birdsey is the supposedly sane
identical twin. His brother, Thomas, suffers from acute
schizophrenia, which causes him to enter a public library and chop
off one hand in a protest against the looming Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the two never knew their real father; their stepfather
was a raging jerk, and their grandfather was an immigrant from
Sicily with a closet full of skeletons. Dominick, we soon learn, is
not exactly an exemplar of mental health himself. The dramatic
possibilities here are endless.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lamb insists on exploring all of them _ at
length. By page 600 or so, this gets maddening. We don't need to
know all this stuff. The story sizzles in the beginning, but
reading for the umpteenth time how angry Dominick Birdsey is at the
world gets a little tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just when you want to lay the book down and never again pick
it up, the story regains its momentum. Come to think of it, I had a
hard time putting the book down at all, even during the tedious
times, because Lamb writes so well, and his characters are so well
drawn. They linger continually on the edge of crisis and/or
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   I read the last 150 pages in one sitting, and was rewarded with
a satisfying ending.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE AN EDITOR IN THE HOUSE? Lamb, even with the oomph of
Oprah, has cost himself readers because of the book's unnecessary
tonnage. ``I Know This Much Is True'' could have lost a third of
its length and none of its considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, it's still worthwhile. After 900 pages and three
weeks, I admit to being a little sad upon coming to the last page,
the frustration of the middle pages long forgiven.
