<HEADLINE> 'West Wing,''Morrie' Win at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a landslide any politician would envy,
NBC's idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The
West Wing,'' won a record-setting nine Emmy awards Sunday night
including best drama series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rubout in the political drama's competition with HBO's
''The Sopranos.'' James Gandolfini, who plays ''The Sopranos'''
hulking mob boss, avoided a shutout for his show by winning best
actor.
</P>
<P>
   The haul for ''The West Wing'' broke the previous record of
eight Emmys for a series in a single season, set by ''ER'' and
''Hill Street Blues'' in their first years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be no living with me now,'' said ''West
Wing'' creator Aaron Sorkin, who won an Emmy for his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox was a sentimental winner of the best actor award
for a comedy. Fox retired from his comedy about a New York City
mayoral office, ''Spin City,'' after last season because of
Parkinson's disease. He won three best actor trophies in a row in
the 1980s for ''Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks. It's been a great ride and stay tuned,'' Fox said,
after receiving a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will &AMP; Grace'' won best comedy show, a big boost for NBC's
sitcom as it moves to Thursday nights this fall. It also won two
awards for its supporting actors, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Heaton, who plays the long-suffering wife of comedian
Ray Romano on the CBS comedy ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' won best
actress in a comedy. It was her first award.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actor Jack Lemmon, a Hollywood favorite, drew a standing
ovation when he won best actor in a miniseries or movie for ''Oprah
Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie.'' His co-star, Hank Azaria,
also won an Emmy, and the show was honored as best TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''A little bit of magic,'' said Lemmon, fighting back tears as
he paid tribute to his family: ''This and what I do, is important.
But you are my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward was an upset winner in the best actress category in a
drama for ABC's ''Once and Again.'' She beat out two competing
actresses from ''The Sopranos,'' Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini, in taking home the only trophy for HBO's
groundbreaking series, said, ''I can't really explain this, except
the academy maybe has an affinity for slightly overweight bald
men.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-show buzz was about the faceoff between ''The West
Wing'' and ''The Sopranos,'' the politicians against the mobsters.
Both had 18 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West Wing'' won in a walk. Richard Schiff, who plays the
grim aide Toby Ziegler, and Allison Janney, who portrays the White
House's tough press secretary, won supporting actor awards. Thomas
Schlamme won for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love every member of my cast,'' Janney said. ''This should
be an ensemble award and I share it with all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Janney paid tribute to fellow nominee Nancy Marchand, who played
the scheming matriarch Livia Soprano. Marchand died of lung cancer
on June 18. Janney called Marchand ''exquisite, elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC won bragging rights with 23 Emmys. HBO had 20 awards, ABC
had 15, Fox had 11 and CBS had 7.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, David Letterman's ''Late Show'' won
the award for best variety series. It came during a year Letterman
had to take a break for an emergency quintuple bypass operation in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dave, if you're watching at home, it looks like the fake heart
surgery paid off,'' said the show's executive producer, Rob
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's series about a Baltimore inner-city neighborhood, ''The
Corner,'' won three Emmys, including outstanding miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO
special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest television events of the past year -- ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' -- weren't competing Sunday.
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys and
''Survivor'' missed the cutoff for nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Host Garry Shandling did a ''Survivor'' takeoff in his opening
segment, though, and several contestants were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest,''
Shandling said. ''I think real people should not be on television.
It's for special people like us, people who have trained and
studied to appear to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in
voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out
videotapes for voters to watch at home. As a result, it nearly
quadrupled the number of people voting.
</P>
<P>
   Many actors, including John Lithgow and David Schwimmer, wore
gold ribbons in a show of support for the Screen Actors Guild and
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who are
involved in a strike against the advertising industry.
