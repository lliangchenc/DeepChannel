NO LINK SEEN BETWEEN EXPLOSION AT N.C. CLINIC AND BOMBING FUGITIVE

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal officials said on Monday that there was no
evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive
charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an
abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion
because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in
Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was
last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Asheville, federal investigators were
careful to say that they had not definitively excluded Rudolph as a
suspect. But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews
on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb
probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying at this time that we have no evidence that this
is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' said Mark Calloway, the U.S.
attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. ``But it's
early in the investigation, and we're not drawing any conclusions
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Enderson, the FBI agent directing the task force that is
searching for Rudolph, said in a statement that ``there is no
reason to believe'' that Rudolph has any connection to the
Asheville attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another federal investigator, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, was even more explicit. ``We see no linkage,'' the
law-enforcement official said. ``This device is much different than
the devices associated with Rudolph. In a world where anything is
possible, I can't slam any doors because we don't have Rudolph in
custody and we don't know who did it in Asheville. But there are a
lot of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have painstakingly analyzed the components of the
bombs Rudolph is accused of building, and have found numerous
similarities between their parts and their design.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb in Asheville exploded shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday
outside the Femcare Clinic, the only abortion provider in western
North Carolina. The clinic was scheduled to open at 8 a.m. No one
was injured, and the bomb caused little damage because it did not
fully detonate. There were no warnings before the blast, and no
person or group has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Femcare Clinic has never been hit by a violent attack, but
it has been the site of regular protests by anti-abortion
demonstrators. It also received a hoax letter that purported to
contain anthrax last month and a threatening telephone call last
July, Calloway said.
</P>
<P>
   If the bomb had fully detonated, the damage would have been
severe, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in North Carolina. ``It
would have devastated that entire end of the building and
penetrated into the building some approximately 40 feet or so to 60
feet, with fairly complete destruction,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bomb did not explode completely, investigators have
gathered far more information about its components than is usually
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a
fugitive since Jan. 30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed the
New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at
Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan. 16, 1997, bombing of a
north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the
Feb. 21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police
officer in Birmingham, and injured 124. Rudolph remains on the
FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. A reward of $1 million
has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
