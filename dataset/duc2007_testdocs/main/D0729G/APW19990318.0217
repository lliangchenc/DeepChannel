<HEADLINE> FBI May Curtail Rudolph Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI may reduce the number of agents  
assigned to the year-old hunt for a suspected bomber in a remote 
area of North Carolina, Director Louis Freeh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are 
hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre 
Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
	The two federal agencies have a total of about 50 investigators  
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents of the area, while grateful for the lengthy  
manhunt, nevertheless are feeling a little overwhelmed, said Rep. 
Charles Taylor, R-N.C.. 
</P>
<P>
	``My office gets complaints about helicopters flying over church  
and about being stopped by uniformed officers all the time. They 
wonder how long the FBI is going to be in there,'' said Taylor, who 
serves on the House Appropriations Committee's panel on commerce, 
justice, state and judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, testifying before the panel, said: ``We are very  
sensitive to the community. ... We try to be as low-profile as you 
can be conducting a search like this. We are looking to modify 
those resources to some degree in terms of downsizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not captured Rudolph, but the manhunt has had  
some positive results, Freeh told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do feel that our presence there has prevented him from  
committing more bombings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,  
including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, in which a 
woman died. Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 
1998 explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the 
New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reported sighting of Rudolph since July 11,  
when health food store owner George Nordmann told authorities 
Rudolph had come to his home in nearby Nantahala and taken six 
months' worth of food and supplies.
