   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Battling heat and occasional rattlesnakes, an
army of law officers continued Monday to seek bombing suspect Eric
Robert Rudolph foot by foot in rugged mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that agents may have found fresh footprints of the
Birmingham bombing suspect in the Nantahala National Forest,
federal agents Monday returned to the store where Rudolph bought a
pair of boots in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They came and asked if they could see the boot that Eric
bought,'' said Kathy Jo Roper of Roper's Boot Store in the nearby
rural community of Topton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the boot outside and made impressions in the sand
and dirt outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents visited the store in February during the early days of
the now six-month-old manhunt for Rudolph. At the time they
purchased a pair of the same style and size of Danner insulated
hunting boots bought by Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why agents returned for more boots, and U.S.
Justice Department spokesman Patrick Crosby declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's WBS-TV, citing sources, reported Monday that searchers
had found a fingerprint matching Rudolph's at an abandoned
campsite.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing Monday, the chief of the Southeast Bomb
Taskforce said teams skilled in tracking are combing the
surrounding mountains. The teams include tracking dogs and heavily
armed tactical units of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, said taskforce chief Woody Enderson.
</P>
<P>
   They are searching an area known as the Tusquitee range, which
has 5,000-foot-high peaks, dense hardwood forests and thickets of
rhododendron that are virtually impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible for a team to to cover 10 to 15 miles in a
day,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered 10 square miles since last week... It's progress
as well as we could hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 31, is charged with bombing a Birmingham abortion
clinic Jan. 29, killing an off-duty policeman who was moonlighting
as a security guard and severely wounded a nurse. He also is wanted
for questioning in three Atlanta bombings, including the 1996
Olympics blast that killed one and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Until he emerged July 9 and obtained food, Rudolph had not been
seen early February, when his abandoned pickup truck was found
outside Murphy.
