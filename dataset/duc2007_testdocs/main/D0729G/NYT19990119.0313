 &HT;    Agents credit manhunt for bombings' absence

   Andrews, N.C. _ After four bombings in 19 months in Georgia and
Alabama, the bombings stopped, and the chief of a regional bombing
task force said Tuesday he believes the reason is that agents have
kept fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph bottled up in North Carolina's
mountains for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly nail bombings, which investigators have said are
related, began with the Atlanta Olympics in July 1996 and ended
with the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most extensive manhunts in recent American history
nears its one-year anniversary, Woody Enderson, the FBI special
agent in charge of the multiagency Southeast Bomb Task Force, said
authorities think the fact that there have been no more bombings
since the fatal Alabama attack means that suspect Rudolph is their
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that he is a bomber, and I feel very
strongly that if we have done nothing else in the past year but
keep him from doing another bombing, we've been successful,''
Enderson said at a news conference in Andrews. ``I have great fear
that if we leave and just back away, someone else might die, and I
don't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 federal and state officers continue to search the
rugged mountains of the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest for
the former soldier and self-employed carpenter. Rudolph, 32, who
grew up exploring these mountains, is said by friends and family to
be an expert outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said authorities think he may be hiding in a bunker,
abandoned mine or cave. In addition, he said, a number of
burglaries of mountain cabins and sightings of unidentified persons
by residents in recent months lead authorities to believe Rudolph
is still in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know an awful lot about Eric Rudolph from friends and
associates. From going into great detail about his background, we
know he feels very comfortable in this area,'' Enderson said.
``Everything we know about him leads us to believe that he will not
leave this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph apparently fled into the wilderness the day after the
Birmingham attack once he realized authorities were on his trail. A
gray Nissan pickup truck registered to Rudolph was seen near the
clinic in Birmingham shortly after the attack. That information led
agents to his rented mobile home near Murphy, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph surfaced briefly in July to obtain food from a friend
and again disappeared into mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said agents believe the food is now running low and he
will soon make a move to obtain more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Birmingham and Olympic bombings, Rudolph is
charged with the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic
and an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham attack killed an off-duty police officer working
as a security guard at the clinic and seriously wounded a nurse.
The Centennial Olympic Park explosion killed one person and injured
111.
