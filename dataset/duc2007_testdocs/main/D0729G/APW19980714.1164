	   ANDREWS, North Carolina (AP) _ The manhunt intensified again for
abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said
he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last
week.
	   Rudolph, on the run nearly six months following the Alabama
bombing, was seen Thursday by the man officials say he robbed. He
disappeared after ditching the truck at a campground that leads
into the mountains and areas honeycombed with caves, according to
authorities.
	   Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man,
who operates a health food store.
	   However ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food
from was a friend. And the network, citing FBI sources, said
Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
	   Rudolph's friend waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff,
according ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a
great hiding place.
	   NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and
a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
	   Calls to authorities by The Associated Press seeking comment on
the reports weren't immediately returned Tuesday night.
	   The area where Rudolph disappeared is at the southern tip of the
Appalachians.
	   Members of the Southeast Bombing Task Force converged on this
area near the tip of western North Carolina with bloodhounds and
extra manpower.
	   Rudolph, a 31-year-old outdoorsman and carpenter, is charged in
the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic, which killed
an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse in
Birmingham, Alabama. He also is wanted for questioning three
bombings in Georgia, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Park
bombing.
	   The FBI placed Rudolph on its 10 most wanted list on May 6 and
increased the reward to dlrs 1 million for anyone with information
leading to his arrest and conviction.
	   Since he was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has
evaded a nationwide search. The reward for information leading to
his capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
	   Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings
in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in
July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100. The other
attacks in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and
at a gay nightclub in February 1997.
