 &HT;    Fearing Rudolph is on 'unfinished mission,' searchers to change
tactics

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Randy Weaver will be in the co-pilot's seat of Bo
Gritz' Cessna today when it touches down in Andrews, N. C., where
the friends _ one a separatist and the other the highest decorated
Green Beret commander from the Vietnam war _ will undertake their
mission to hopefully escort Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert
Rudolph out of the mountains and down a safe corridor through the
federal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, of the infamous Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho, knows all too
well what Rudolph is up against.
</P>
<P>
   A missed court date in 1991 over a minor weapons charge led to
an 18-month high-tech reconnaissance mission by federal agents that
on Aug. 21, 1992, was whipped into chaos after an agent shot one of
Weaver's barking dogs that was blowing their camouflaged cover. The
standoff ended 11 days later, with Weaver wounded and his wife and
son dead.
</P>
<P>
   Never again do federal agents want another Ruby Ridge. They have
said that once they find Rudolph's hiding place, it could take
weeks, even months to negotiate him out.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force say they know Rudolph
is armed with long guns. Investigators said tests conducted at the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) lab in Atlanta
has detected dynamite residue in both trucks _ one was his and one
he allegedly stole_ that Rudolph has driven since the Jan. 29
bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is wanted for questioning in connection with the deadly
July 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, January 1997
double-blast at an Atlanta-area abortion clinic and a February 1997
blast at a gay Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 million dollar reward on his head has made information
leading to Rudolph's arrest a hot commodity for bounty hunters. His
mother, Pat Rudolph, has released statements of concern for her
son's life and the safety of the lawmen tracking him.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver will appeal to Mrs. Rudolph, who lives in Florida but is
currently in North Carolina, that her son should give himself up,
said Vicci Gritz, the former soldier's daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (federal agents) feel like she might have some kind of
contact with him somehow,'' Vicci Gritz said. ``Randy will reason
with her so she can reason with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had no comment about the claim that Pat
Rudolph talks to her son, probably by telephone. ``When they
searched Eric Rudolph's home, he had some of our training videos,''
Vicci Gritz said. ``We have not had any contact with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 59, who has a daily radio show that can be picked up on
shortwave, plans to muster at least 100 volunteers to go into the
mountains this weekend. Any participants must sign a waiver of the
reward, because Gritz has promised it to Rudolph's mother to use
for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic had not been embraced by the FBI Wednesday, Vicci
Gritz said. But that's all Gritz may have to offer Rudolph, who
could face the death penalty. ``I don't think these guys are going
to be effective,'' said retired FBI Agent Robert Ressler, one of
the original and most experienced profilers of criminals. ``(Gritz)
cannot trust the government unless he gets something in writing.
Today they may say something and tomorrow say another, depending on
which way the political winds are blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jones, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama,
said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Justice Department guidelines, we can't make that
decision until he's in custody and indicted,'' Jones said. ``It's
my understanding that that decision will be made in Washington.
There will be a recommendation from our office, but the ultimate
decision will be left in the hands of the (U.S.) attorney
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressler said death by lethal injection will never deter some of
today's new brand of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the death penalty to prevent acts of terrorism is a
joke,'' he said. ``If you are mission oriented and willing to die
for the cause....the death penalty is nothing more than a political
football.'' Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta ATF office has said
investigators believe Rudolph is on an unfinished mission.
Investigators said that might include hurting a group of agents or
even media workers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said all along that Rudolph was hiding in the
Nantahala where he spent his adolescence honing his skills in the
woods . It's where he is the most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Rudolph proved their theory correct when he emerged
in search of food and provisions from an elderly health store food
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin has said it was not Rudolph's intention to run away or
leave the country. His intentions, investigators said they believe,
are to finish the job he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his ultimate plan is to finish his mission, he's a very
dangerous man,''Ressler said. ``Rather than negotiate, I think it's
imperative to nail him and get him under control.''
