<HEADLINE> Gore Fund-raiser Targets Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what was billed as the capital's first  
presidential fund-raiser aimed at gays and lesbians, Tipper Gore 
scooped up more than $150,000 for her husband's campaign Thursday 
and promised contributors he would ``fight for your dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All people, regardless of sexual orientation, should be able  
to be a part of a loving relationship in a family without fear of 
recrimination or discrimination,'' Mrs. Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gore administration, she pledged, would ``stand against forces  
of hatred.'' Her husband, Vice President Al Gore, ``will fight for 
your dreams. He will fight for OUR dreams,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore did not get into specifics of the gay policy agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	The wife of the vice president unflappably dealt with three AIDS  
demonstrators who, one by one, tried to disrupt her appearance 
among some 400 in a small hotel ballroom with cries of ``Gore's 
greed kills!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, escorted out by Secret Service agents, accused  
Al Gore of siding with pharmaceutical companies in an international 
trade dispute and trying to block South Africa's access to cheap, 
generic AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought you might be here tonight,'' Mrs. Gore said.  
``That's certainly something we all have a great deal of 
appreciation for -- free speech and a passion about issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel, nine activists affiliated with the group  
called ACT-UP carried signs calling Al Gore a ``drug company 
puppet'' and mocking his campaign as ``Apartheid 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights  
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political group, 
attended the reception as a ``gold level'' contributor to ``Gays 
and Lesbians for Gore.'' But he said he group's presidential 
endorsements were still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solid and deep'' is how Birch described the vice president's  
record on matters important to the gay community. Former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, 
has voted the right way on gay issues but ``is not a stand-out,'' 
Birch said.
