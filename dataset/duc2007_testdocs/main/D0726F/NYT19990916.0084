 GORE DISPLAYS ENDORSEMENTS ON EVE OF VISIT  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
On the eve of his 59th trip to California, Vice President Al Gore
has released a list of new endorsements for his 2000 presidential
bid from state congressional leaders _ including U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
<P>
   Gore's campaign had been the target of recent criticism from GOP
leaders saying he lacks the thick roster of endorsements compiled
by Republican front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But his two-day trip beginning Thursday, to include stops in Los
Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco, is designed in part to showcase
the formal endorsement of Gov. Gray Davis _ who will tour
California with him _ as well as other state Democratic leaders.
Gore will speak to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
visit a public high school and speak to labor leaders during his
state trip.
</P>
<P>
   Among the members of the California Democratic congressional
delegation who announced their formal endorsements of Gore's
presidential campaign Wednesday were Lois Capps of Santa Barbara,
Gary Condit of Modesto, Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, Bob Filner of
Chula Vista, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Bob
Matsui of Sacramento, Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Mike
Thompson of Napa.

   ``It shows they have seen the type of leadership that Al Gore
has brought to this country and ... the working families of
California,'' said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar Wednesday. ``They
recognize the vice president has a serious commitment to standing
up for the issues that are important to the people of California _
and he'll continue to do so as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has previously won the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Barbara
Boxer, as well as state Democratic U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los
Angeles, Howard Berman of Mission Hills, Cal Dooly of Hanford, Zoe
Lofgren of San Jose, Matthew Martinez of Alhambra, Juanita
Millender-McDonald of Torrance, Grace Napolitano of Norwalk and
Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has long expressed her support of Gore's 2000
presidential bid, but made her endorsement formal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Al Gore has demonstrated time and time again he
is dedicated to the people of the United States _ be it reducing
gun violence, protecting our environment, bolstering patients
rights, safeguarding a woman's right to choose or reforming public
education,'' said Feinstein in a statement released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She lauded Gore as ``a leader with a proven record of fighting
on our behalf,'' saying, ``He has also demonstrated a strong
commitment to my home state of California _ helping our schools,
funding job programs, &LR;  and promoting the development of high-tech
industries that have fueled our economic growth.''  &LR;
