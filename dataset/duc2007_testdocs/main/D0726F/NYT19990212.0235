   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore emerges from President
Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign
strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue
the embattled chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's campaign for the White House faces a
fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to
criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish
itself more effectively from Clinton on the hot-button issue of
personal values.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, impeached by the House for perjury and obstruction of
justice for trying to conceal his dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, was acquitted by the Senate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all condemned the president's personal conduct on an
individual basis,'' said a prominent Democratic lawmaker who has
been involved in national Democratic fund-raising efforts. ``But we
need Gore to speak for all Democrats and make our stance more clear
to help us reclaim the values issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior official in Gore's presidential campaign, speaking on
condition anonymity, said Gore may ``say something again'' about
Clinton's personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people are tired of hearing about this,''
the official added. ``They want us to start talking about their
problems and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore issued a statement Friday welcoming Senate acquittal of
Clinton and urging the nation to ``heal the wounds of this
impeachment debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``I know that President Clinton is eager to work
across party lines on these and other challenges. And I know that
his leadership will continue to be good'' for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore plans to gradually highlight differences with
Clinton on policies and programs later this spring as he shifts
into campaign mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk about what we're going to do _ and not
about what we did,'' his campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist who has twice
campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, says that
Gore emerges from Clinton's impeachment fight as a formidable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger because he has the absolute support of a strong
president, a robust economy and has made no outstanding mistakes,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added in an interview on CNN that he may compete against
Gore for the Democratic nomination in order to ``broaden the base
of our party.'' Gore must ``earn the nomination, not inherit the
nomination,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard,
says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable
delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, owes his shot at the
White House to Clinton, the Arkansas governor who defied
conventional electoral strategy in 1992 by naming a fellow
southerner to join a baby-boom ticket. Gore was born in 1948,
Clinton in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored his loyalty to Clinton in the depths of the
impeachment fight at a Democratic pep rally on the White House lawn
on Dec. 19, hours after the House voted to impeach a president for
first time in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ``acknowledged that what he did was wrong,'' Gore
said, adding that the nation must also ``acknowledge that invoking
the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan politics
is wrong.'' Gore then introduced Clinton as ``my friend, America's
great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that Gore must now ``look for an opportunity to
express unhappiness with the president's conduct'' sometime over
the next month. ``You do it; you say you've done it; and you move
on,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Party in
New Hampshire, the state planning to hold the nation's first
presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New
Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``scores a lot of points for loyalty to the president,''
Sullivan said. Gore's fidelity and commitment to his family are so
widely known that he doesn't need to highlight differences with
Clinton on values, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront
his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, and to begin taking on potential Republican
challengers such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most formidable Democratic challenger has already stepped
aside. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri announced
in early February that he would abandon a threatened bid for the
Democratic nomination in favor of efforts to help Democrats reclaim
political control of the House that was lost to Republicans in 1994
for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have also
announced they will forego presidential campaigns in 2000. Gore
still could face challenges for the Democratic nomination from Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore well ahead of all potential Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also show that Gore's stature has barely dimmed as a
result of six years of service in the White House. A survey for ABC
News in May 1994 found that 58 percent of American adults had a
favorable impression of Gore; a survey for Time/CNN conducted last
month found 58 percent of respondents had a favorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said Gore has emerged from Clinton's travails largely
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add it all up, I don't think that it's had a
tremendous impact on Gore,'' Sabato said. ``Gore's popularity stems
from the economy. If we continue to have a good economy, he will
continue to benefit.''

<P>
   Gore, who opened a campaign headquarters in Washington in early
February, is building his bid to succeed Clinton on powers of
incumbency. A Washington insider and son of a senator, he has
served in the House, Senate and White House for 22 years. Gore
crisscrosses the nation on thinly veiled political missions to
announce federal grants in early caucus or primary states such as
Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's blessing, Gore increasingly steps forward to
spotlight initiatives that court powerful Democratic constituencies
including labor unions, women, African-Americans, Hispanics and
liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointedly cited Gore's ``visionary leadership'' in his
own nationally televised State of the Union address on Jan. 19 and
followed up with praise the next day at campaign events in Buffalo,
N.Y., and Norristown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say without qualification that no vice president in
history has had so much responsibility or done so much good,''
Clinton told a boisterous rally in Norristown.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tapping into a network of loyal Democratic campaign
donors whose contributions to the Clinton-Gore ticket and the
Democratic Party in 1992 and 1996 enabled Democrats to mount the
most expensive presidential campaign in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Gore will easily raise the $33 million by
year's end that is permitted for presidential candidates accepting
federal matching funds. Attorney General Janet Reno last year
cleared Gore of any wrongdoing in the Democrats' controversial 1996
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential primaries are stacked early in 2000, playing
into the hands of an elected official with a built-in platform.
Some 35 states are expected to have held their primaries by March
21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has history on his side as well. Four of the five
Democratic vice presidents who have sought the party's nomination
since World War II have captured the nomination. Five of the last
10 presidents first served as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence
recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he
prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and
Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Polls asking voters about a hypothetical race show Gore trailing
two undeclared Republican presidential candidates. A Los Angles
Times survey completed Jan. 29 showed Bush, the Texas governor,
topping Gore 57 percent to 39 percent. The same study found Mrs.
Dole beating Gore 50 percent to 42 percent.
