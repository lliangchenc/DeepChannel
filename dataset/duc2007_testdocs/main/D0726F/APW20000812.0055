<HEADLINE> Woman makes yarmulkes for Gore-Lieberman ticket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Stamford woman has become the official
yarmulke maker of the Gore-Lieberman presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that Stamford-native Lieberman had been chosen as
Al Gore's running mate, Marsha Greenberg decided to knit him a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was a blue yarmulke with red and white striped
letters reading, ''Gore-Lieberman 2000.'' A yarmulke is a skull cap
worn by Jewish males as a sign of humility before God.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the first Orthodox Jew who's gotten so far, I knew he would
wear it if I could get it to him,'' she said. ''It's the campaign
yarmulke.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg called Harold Bernstein, a cousin of Lieberman and
president of Congregation Agudath Sholom, which she attends.
Bernstein passed along the skull cap to one of Lieberman's aides at
the Italian Center of Stamford, where the senator and Vice
President Al Gore visited Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg was later told about a playful struggle between the
two candidates over her handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Lieberman thought it was wonderful, but Gore just
flipped and took it from Lieberman,'' Greenberg said. ''It was like
two boys fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when it became apparent Gore really was intent on
keeping the yarmulke, a Lieberman aide called Bernstein to ask
Greenberg if she could make another for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein will take the yarmulke to the Democratic Convention in
Los Angeles next week to present it to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said it takes about eight hours of stitch-work to
complete the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I start with six stitches in the center and keep making loops
outward,'' she said. ''It's very tedious, but I sit in front of the
television or take it with me on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is a musician but said she has always made yarmulkes
as a sideline for friends and family. She said she was flattered
that Gore wanted her yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore broke ground by selecting Senator Lieberman,'' Greenberg
said. ''He's not shying away from Lieberman's religion. He's
embracing it. It's wonderful to see.''
