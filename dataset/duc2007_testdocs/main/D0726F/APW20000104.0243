<HEADLINE> Sen. Kennedy To Endorse Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for
president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in
New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's nominating
convention. The decision to act now came after reflection over the Christmas
holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's, according to
people in the Kennedy camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore supporters had pushed for the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, remains a liberal hero to many
Democrats. He sought the presidency himself in 1980 and has served in the Senate
not only with both Gore and rival Democratic contender Bill Bradley but with the
vice president's father, Al Gore Sr., in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy and Gore planned to appear at a Boston middle school to talk about
education policy on Wednesday before driving north to Portsmouth, N.H., to
discuss health care with senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's
campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, the vice president has seen his once sizable lead in the
polls diminish in the face of a strong challenge from Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator. That has caused some Democrats to wish out loud that Kennedy
would announce an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy camp said the endorsement should not be viewed as a slap against
Bradley, who has unveiled a health care plan that Gore has criticized.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested the development only bolstered his contention that Gore,
unlike him, is a Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought all along he would have more of the establishment support,''
Bradley told reporters in Bedford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I have are the people. He has entrenched power, he has a president who
is supporting him, loyal to him -- as he was loyal to the president -- he's got
most of the DNC (Democratic National Committee), he's got most of the big
Democratic fund-raisers, he rides on Air Force Two. That is entrenched power,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy endorsement is sure to garner huge coverage in the Boston media
-- which spills into vote-rich southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   It may also trigger other endorsements by the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, which largely has held off endorsing in the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, speaking with reporters after addressing students at the
high school in this seacoast community, was clearly pleased by the development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anybody in the modern history of America has really
accomplished more in the United States Senate over the course of a career than
Ted Kennedy,'' Gore said.
