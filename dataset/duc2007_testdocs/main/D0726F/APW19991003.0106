	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his  
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will 
stay on despite a government report that found questionable 
financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 
1998 world's fair in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him  
and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been 
doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think  
Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 
2000 Democratic presidential nomination.

<P>
	``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue  
doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, 
``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball.'' 
</P>

	The State Department's inspector general found potential  
improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the 
world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996. The job, with the United 
State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as 
the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the 
fair.

<P>
	A report by investigators, made public Saturday, found Coelho  
improperly used $210,000 in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily 
kept an expensive chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for 
a $2,500-a-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000  
from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a 
memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's 
records. The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is 
not paid, the inspector general said.
