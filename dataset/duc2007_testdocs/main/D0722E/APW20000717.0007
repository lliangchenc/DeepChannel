<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Needs Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Iran's weekend test of a long-range
missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense
system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, with a range of 800
miles, on Saturday. Tehran is developing a longer-range Shahab-4,
which it claims will be used to carry satellites into space and not
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the
United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially
deploy a national missile defense system that would provide
protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the
United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar
national missile defense system, but Washington has not yet
approved its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also would look to Australia to play a role in
the missile defense system if and when it is approved, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Australia would
consider a request for participation if the system gets the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that expectation could prove unfounded if the opposition
Labor Party wins federal elections expected by late next year.
Labor is opposed to Australian participation in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries jointly run the Pine Gap satellite tracking
center in central Australia and that secretive facility would
likely be used to track missiles as part of the U.S. missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were speaking after the two countries agreed to
share new defense technology and cooperate on its development -- an
agreement that gives Australia enhanced access to U.S. military
research.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the agreement would be of particular benefit to
Australia's troubled fleet of six Collins Class submarines, which
have been plagued by technical problems ranging from periscope
malfunctions to excessive noise and vibration, as well as problems
in computer defense systems.
