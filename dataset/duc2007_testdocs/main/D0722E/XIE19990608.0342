<HEADLINE> U.S. to Conduct Eighth THAAD Anti-Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military will conduct
the eighth test of an anti-missile defense system in New Mexico
State in the country Tuesday morning after seven successive test
failures, the Defense Department announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile is being
developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with
attacking enemy warheads in flight.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's test, postponed two weeks ago when a target missile
went out of control, will be conducted over White Sands, New
Mexico State, missile test range, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
THAAD is designed to protect troops and bases from medium-range
ballistic missile attack. Despite the failures to date, Pentagon
insists that much is learned from each test whether or not the
intercept takes place.
</P>
<P>
The most recent test was aborted May 25 when a Hera target -- a
converted Minuteman missile -- tumbled out of control shortly
after launch. The THAAD missile, designed to collide with and
shatter enemy ballistic missiles, was not launched.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department cited a number of reasons for the THAAD
system's failures so far, including problems with the
target-seeking system on the interceptor rocket.
