PROMINENT SCIENTISTS URGE DELAY IN MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense
system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures
easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear
warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, including several who have served in the past on
Defense Department research panels, said that the government should
delay any decision on whether to proceed with a missile-defense
network, which is expected to cost $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see a lot of ways to get around this system and we
presumed that if a country was able to mount a missile attack
against the United States it was also able to use these well-known
countermeasures to confuse or overwhelm this system,'' said Andrew
Sessler of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The study by 11 physicists and engineers was done by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union of Concerned
Scientists. The scientists based their calculations on
nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense
system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005
_ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will
decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test
whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles ,
ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a
limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans
were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic
missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever
enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum
shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an
interceptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that
the missile defense system is in the early development stage and
that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a prototype and you have to walk before you run,'' said
Mike Biddle, spokesman at the National Missile Defense Office.
</P>
<P>
   In two preliminary tests of the system, the anti-missile missile
or kill vehicle was able to hit a mock warhead only once. As a
result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until June before
Clinton decides whether to approve the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arguing to defer the decision until there has been more
research and development, and tests of various systems using real
world conditions,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The panel studied several potential methods that an enemy might
use to defeat the missile shield, including shiny mylar plastic
balloons, like the kind sold in grocery stores, which the
scientists said could easily fool the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A government intelligence report made public last September
acknowledged that emerging missile states were capable of using
decoys. But Biddle said that, based on classified intelligence
information, the Pentagon is confident that the defense system will
work against against any challenges or countermeasures that could
be mustered by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said that a missile defense system might also be
confused if an enemy enclosed a warhead in an aluminum shield
cooled by liquid nitrogen, foiling the heat-seeking sensors on the
anti-missile missiles sent to destroy the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this defense system the attacker always has the
advantage,'' said George Lewis a panel member from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
