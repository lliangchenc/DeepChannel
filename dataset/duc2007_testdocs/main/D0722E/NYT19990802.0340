SUCCESSFUL TRIAL FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM

   WASHINGTON _ In a second straight success, an experimental
theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday
at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that
the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.9 billion Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD,
has been plagued with problems, and it failed six earlier tests. It
intercepted its first target in June. One failed test in March led
the Pentagon to impose $15 million in penalties against the
developer, Lockheed Martin, and members of Congress had asked the
Pentagon to find another contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's test involved the missile's ability to hit its first
target outside the earth's atmosphere as well as hitting a
separated warhead for the first time, said Jennifer Canaff of the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Canaff said Monday's test was more difficult because the
cooling of the target in outer space reduced the ability of the
missile's infrared sensors to detect it.
</P>
<P>
   Approved in the early 1990s, the program to create a mobile
ground missile defense system against medium-range ballistic
missiles would be used overseas, if it is ultimately deployed.
</P>
<P>
   China has protested American plans to create theater missile
defense systems with Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan to
protect allied and American troops based in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Several independent scientists questioned the importance of
Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested
against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the
results were going to be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to test against realistic targets that actively try
to evade the defense system _ simulate real world targets _ and not
just hit missiles on a test range,'' said Tom Collina, director of
the arms control program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a
Washington watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lockheed Martin say those tests will come in the
next engineering and manufacturing phase of development.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile defense system must still pass one of two final
tests to be held in September and next February before it can move
to that phase.
