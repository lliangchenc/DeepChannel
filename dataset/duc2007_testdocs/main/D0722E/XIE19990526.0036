<HEADLINE> U.S. Target Missile Problem Thwarts Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army scratched
Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a
problem with the one that was to serve as its target.
</P>
<P>
The Hera target missile -- a modified Minuteman 2 -- was fired
from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico State of the
United States. The Army had planned to launch a Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile to knock the target
missile out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim
Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit
flying targets. The system has cost at least 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department charged Lockheed Martin Corporation, the
maker of the antimissile system, a 15-million-U.S.-dollar penalty
for not achieving a hit during a March 29 test as required by its
15 billion U.S. dollars contract.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at
least 800 miles away _ the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran,
North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to
U.S. troops and allies overseas.
</P>
<P>
The antimissile missile has technology that is the most
sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to
development of a system that could protect the United States.
