<HEADLINE> Pentagon Awards Boeing Contract on Missile Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Department on Thursday awarded a research and development contract
to Seattle's Boeing Co. to coordinate a missile-defense system,
Defense Secretary William Cohen announced.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design,
develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a
space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation
against ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
During the research, Boeing will design a system of
ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for
missile launch detection and communications. They will be tied
together with a sophisticated battle management control.
</P>
<P>
If the system works, the Pentagon could make a decision to
deploy it in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the value of the contract could eventually
reach 5.2 billion dollars if the system works and moves towards
deployment.
</P>
<P>
The NMD, emerging from former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's
"Star Wars" program, is to stop a smaller or accidental attack by
another country against the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has spent billions of dollars on nuclear
missile defense since Reagan put up his plan more than a decade
ago, but little success has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military is also trying to develop an even more
limited Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program to protect troops
and bases from missile attack around the world. But that program
has experienced four successive failures.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen said the United States was making "great
progress" towards solving the technological problems involved in
producing a national missile defense system.
