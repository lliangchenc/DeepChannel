WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military today tested
over the Pacific Ocean a sensor designed to detect and track
incoming nuclear missiles, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
A rocket carrying an optical sensor and data system was fired
from Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands for the test
under the national missile defense program, it said.
</P>
<P>
The sensor, built by Boeing Company, located dummy warhead
targets from a Minuteman-2 missile launched 21 minutes earlier
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.
</P>
<P>
Now in its initial test stage, the sensor is designed to be
mounted on small rockets to collide with enemy nuclear warheads
once they are identified and tracked.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a
national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether
to deploy it within three years.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has announced plans to spend an
additional 2 billion dollars on the multi-billion missile defense
program over the next five years.
