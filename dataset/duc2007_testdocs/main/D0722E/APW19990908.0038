<HEADLINE> Alaska May Be Missile Defense Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has selected Alaska  
as the likely first site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile 
defense network. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin, who announced the  
decision Wednesday, said the administration won't decide whether to 
deploy a missile defense until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin spoke as U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow opened two  
days of negotiations on the terms under which a missile defense 
could be established. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in the  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national defense 
against such missiles. The theory was that leaving both sides 
vulnerable deterred nuclear attacks because either country would 
face deadly retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Wednesday began two  
days of talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov 
on reducing nuclear stockpiles and possibly changing the treaty. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen also is expected to discuss the 
issue with his Russian counterpart on a trip to Moscow next Monday 
and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, hard pressed financially to create its own anti-missile  
defense, is reluctant to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States wants to modify the treaty so it can build  
a limited defense against attack by rogue states, such as North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has made some decisions that will enable us to  
begin engaging Russia now on changes on the ABM treaty that would 
be necessary if we seek to deploy a limited national missile 
defense system,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin agreed in June to discuss ABM  
modifications, but Russian officials continue to insist that an 
anti-missile defense system in the United States would tilt the 
strategic balance and start a new arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington argues the system would not upset strategic stability  
because it would not be effective against a massive attack of the 
kind Russia is capable of launching.
