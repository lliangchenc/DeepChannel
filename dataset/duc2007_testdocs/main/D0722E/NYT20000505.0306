<P>
   The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized
quarrel over a national missile defense. President Clinton has said
he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to
protect against several dozen long-range missiles. Russian
President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification
of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has
warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty
to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the
START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on
limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be greater. The $60 billion system
contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation
with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize
China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental
ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a
chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation. India would
probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear
missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost
certain to follow suit. Even Japan could be tempted to use its
stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons
club.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for national missile defense is more compelling
than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept. Instead of
trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of
Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a
defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state
such as North Korea or Libya. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
has said that the system would not and could not be a defense
against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of
the mutually assured destruction concept.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider
when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat
to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost. The
first cannot be accurately calculated. No one knows what rogue
states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest
it could act as a deterrent. The effect on nonproliferation could
be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
</P>
<P>
   As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60
billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile
defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund. Members of the
current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the
latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that
other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the
politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the
system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by
countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of
deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads
that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would
overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among
hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys. The sensors of the
current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy
balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer
has not been tested against realistic countermeasures. There is no
evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become
operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling
shrouds on incoming warheads. Plus, there have been no real-world
tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be
completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting
balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a missile launched against the United States would
be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no
doubt from whence it came. A nation making such an attack could
expect instant destruction.
</P>
<P>
   No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense
should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by
disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by
countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of
delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile
defense system will be developed. But there is no such thing in
existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system
threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The true challenges of creating a national missile defense
should be debated in the coming presidential campaign. Research
should continue on missile defense, and a commission of
distinguished, independent scientists should be established to
assess future tests against real-world countermeasures. But for the
present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense
option.
