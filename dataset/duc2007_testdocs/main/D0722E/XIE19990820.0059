<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Skip Final Test of Missile Interceptor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an
anti-missile missile.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into
the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's
effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied
troops and their staging areas.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes
instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed
Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be
fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter
Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have
"proven" that the missile works. Critics, however, said after the
second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be
tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets
used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
</P>
<P>
He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning
the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will
translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will
enter initial low-rate production. The Pentagon is scheduled to
begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test
will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars
on THAAD so far. Skipping the final flight test will save 15
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin
to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts. The
missile had failed in its first six attempts to shoot down a mock
warhead, but it recorded its first success on June 10 this year,
followed by another August 2.
