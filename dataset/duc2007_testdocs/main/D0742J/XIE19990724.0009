<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Kennedy family and friends
paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr, son of the
former U.S. president, his wife and her sister in a private
memorial service in a New York church.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 people attended the memorial service including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
The service was held well out of the gaze of the public, which
has followed every detail since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane
crash a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and her sister, 34, were killed when
the small private plane Kennedy was piloting crashed into the
Atlantic off the Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the
United States on July 16.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were recovered Wednesday, and the ashes of the three
were committed to the sea, near the spot where they died, in a
simple and private ceremony on a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday.
