<HEADLINE> Kennedy Plane Wreckage Transported </HEADLINE>

	OTIS AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. (AP) -- Two flatbed trucks under  
police escort transported wreckage from the John F. Kennedy Jr. 
plane crash to the Coast Guard hangar where it will be examined in 
detail by federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga, described as ``twisted  
metal,'' arrived late Friday night, a Coast Guard official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the  
investigation, hopes to learn what happened July 16 that caused the 
plane to dive into the sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	However authorities have acknowledged they may never find the  
reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and 
sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have emerged that there was no mechanical failure in the  
engine or with the craft's propellers. CBS news reported Friday 
night that preliminary reports showed pilot error is suspected to 
be the cause behind the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, only one regional investigator would be assigned to  
examine the cause of a small plane crash, NTSB spokesman Paul 
Schlamm told the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kennedy crash, a team of eight or nine people will  
investigate, Schlamm said, including specialists such as 
metallurgists, meteorologists and structures experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board will examine all the available parts to figure  
out how the plane broke up -- and the cause of the break-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it an impact break? Was there a crack? Was there something  
pre-existing?'' Schlamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are also examining radar data from five states to  
create a more accurate picture of the plane's path before it 
crashed about 7 miles off the coast of Aquinnah. They will analyze 
the plane's history and maintenance records as well as Kennedy's 
pilot experience for more clues to the flight's final records. 
</P>
<P>
	No more of the plane's debris is expected to be recovered, Navy  
Lt. Cmdr. Victor Beck said. About 90 percent of the wreckage has 
been removed from the ocean floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's aboard that's coming aboard,'' Beck said. ``The  
Navy's work here is done.''
