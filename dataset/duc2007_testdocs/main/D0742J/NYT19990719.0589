   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine
aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per
minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his
wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board
were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster
than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been
virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga
II HP out of such a freefall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal
configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ``The normal rate of
descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per
minute for passenger comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional
radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's
plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday
night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's
Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said
the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators,
but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the
plane's rapid descent as being out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers recovered other small pieces of debris from the crash,
but failed to pinpoint the plane's underwater location. Although
investigators believe they have several promising sites within the
24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a
team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable
to find the main portion of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers will be joined this morning by the USS Grasp, a
Navy salvage and recovery vessel based in Little Creek, Va. The
Grasp, with a crew of 100 _ including 22 Navy divers _ arrived at
the scene Monday afternoon, but dive preparations were not
concluded in time to send divers into the 68-degree waters.
</P>
<P>
   Those divers are expected to search the area this morning,
weather permitting. Capt. Jack Gallant, a public information
officer with the Navy, said the divers would make tethered dives,
meaning they would not be as limited in time and depth as divers
with oxygen tanks might be. Should the wreckage be located, Gallant
said, the Grasp would be able to bring it to the surface, using a
40-foot crane with a 200-foot depth capacity. Ocean depths in the
search area are generally between 60 and 80 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said that, while Monday
had been primarily ``a day of preparation,'' today's operations
would be ``extensive.'' Several other ships from the Coast Guard
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will join
in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing
witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the
38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and
her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records
investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious
mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a
reported $300,000 only three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the
plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted
June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours
since its manufacture. Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11,
topping off the tank with 62 gallons. Pearce said there were no
indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling
and Friday's fatal crash. Pearce also noted that the plane's
magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane
anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m. EDT,
investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy
may have had.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was
equipped with a relatively new voice recorder. Pearce said the
recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio
transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if
Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB, said Monday that,
when operating, the system is automatically activated every time
the microphone key is depressed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as the reality of the tragedy of the three
deaths finally became obvious Monday, the families of the victims
briefly broke their silence.
</P>
<P>
   After Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., traveled to Bridgehampton,
N.Y., to meet with and console John Kennedy's sister, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, the Kennedy family released a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss
of John and Carolyn and of Lauren Bessette. John was a shining
light in all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world
that first came to know him when he was a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, another grieving family came to grips with
the loss of two of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these three young people ... was the embodiment of
love, accomplishment and passion for life,'' said a statement from
Carolyn and Lauren Bessette's parents. ``John and Carolyn were true
soul mates, and we hope to honor them in death in the simple manner
in which they chose to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was read in the Bessette family hometown of
Greenwich, Conn., by family friend Grant Stinchfield.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences also poured in from other quarters, with both
President Clinton and GOP presidential hopeful Gov. George W. Bush
addressing the families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who like Kennedy is the son of a former president, said he
sent letters of condolence to Caroline and Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family that has endured a lot of incredible
heartbreak,'' Bush said Monday. ``I wish God's blessings on them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent much of the day in meetings and at a news
conference with newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
said the tragedy represented ``a moment of sadness for the United
States,'' and for his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered his country's ``prayers and thoughts to the
Kennedy family.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, outside the TriBeCa apartment where Kennedy and his
wife lived, a memorial of flowers and notes continued to grow as
neighbors and strangers gathered to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To John John from a Cuban exile,'' read one note, written in
Spanish and wrapped around a large bundle of red roses.
