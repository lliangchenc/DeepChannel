OFFICIALS CALL OFF SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS IN KENNEDY CRASH

<P>
   BOSTON -- Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane
plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials
Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring
Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as an announcement by Coast Guard officials that
the intensive, multiagency mission had shifted from ``search and
rescue'' to ``search and recovery,'' a bureaucratic way of saying
hope had ended of finding them alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the result that we were looking for. This is not
the result we were hoping for,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral
Richard Larrabbee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Larrabbee said divers from the Massachusetts State
Police would begin work Monday investigating two ``potential
targets'' identified by sophisticated sonar as unusual objects on
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly cautioned that, based on the information available
Sunday night, the targets ``don't in any way represent an aircraft
or any parts of it.'' He said the objects were in 60 feet to 80
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made
in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and
had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his
passengers: his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent some very painful moments with the families
tonight,'' a somber Larrabbee said. ``It was very difficult for me
to share the information with them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length
of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours;
the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of
searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the
NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this
type of crash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature
aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide
clues to the Friday night crash.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue
operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper
procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee
tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly
somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three
priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent. Senator
Edward M. Kennedy held a wine chalice while one of the priests
distributed Communion wafers. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F.
Kennedy, also served consecrated wine to the dozen or so people who
attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB
cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to
nine months, and the cause might remain elusive. ``At this point we
do not know. We will not know for some time. There is even a
possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest
and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine
airplane. The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in
diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by
Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head. Coast Guard officials said
widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose
wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren
Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black
boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record
cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many
parameters of an airplane's performance. However, Kennedy's plane
did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard
of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
</P>
<P>
   The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory,
would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of
Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be
turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much
information. An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of
the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed
that ground controllers received no communications or distress
calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have
been in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the
recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture
something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call,
or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who
installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the response time of the search effort were
prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent
at the Martha's Vineyard Airport. Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass., said
he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy
plane to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he
checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane
and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to
land.
</P>
<P>
   Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service
Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes
file their flight plans. Kennedy was not required to file a flight
plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station,
whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked
them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said. The
operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport
station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a
search by the center.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy
was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is
expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been
identified as late, Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will
begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports
in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue
Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a
Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about
2:15 a.m. Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about
4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to
comment on the investigation and the response time.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered
Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at
about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing
in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search
that began early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced
Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of
creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared
to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast
Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already
searched.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off
Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy
search.
</P>
<P>
   The tent at the Kennedy compound where the Mass was said had
been intended for 275 guests invited to the wedding of Rory
Kennedy, the youngest daughter of RFK. John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, and
his 33-year-old wife had planned to attend the wedding Saturday
after dropping off Lauren Bessette, 34, on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was postponed indefinitely, and would-be wedding
guests began trickling into Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis
Sunday to catch flights home. A friend of the Kennedy family said
hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been
replaced by discussions of memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the
family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had
no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends
and associates said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing as they always do: getting through this and
dealing with it,'' said Robert Shrum, a friend and adviser of
Edward Kennedy. ``It is obviously very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to
date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the
Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from
Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Kennedy had to
make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a
northeasterly direction.
</P>
<P>
   He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the
Connecticut coast. He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at
that same altitude. He then began his descent toward Martha's
Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane
at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport,
which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to
1,800 feet. After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m. _ the plane
disappeared from radar.
