   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ On the fifth day of a search that framed a
great national wake, a red sonar blotch led searchers to the bodies
of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his two passengers, entombed in the
shattered fuselage of his plane on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's remains were located before dawn by an underwater
camera checking objects detected by sonar. Several hours later,
Navy divers in heavy-duty gear adjusted the crumpled wreckage and
found the passengers on his flight through black haze last Friday
night _ his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law,
Lauren G. Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   The three bodies, found at 110 feet, about seven miles off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard, were raised at about 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, wearing shorts and
looking exhausted, boarded a Coast Guard helicopter at his compound
in nearby Hyannis Port and was taken to a Navy salvage ship, the
U.S.S. Grasp, to witness the recovery. He was accompanied by his
sons, Rep. Patrick Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy accompanied the bodies on Wednesday night to the
Coast Guard station in this fishing village at the toe of Cape Cod.
Because the deaths were accidental, the bodies were to be autopsied
before being turned over to the families.
</P>
<P>
   The water temperature, about 52 degrees, helped preserve the
bodies, an investigator said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, 38, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga
with his wife and sister-in-law aboard when it was lost in the
Atlantic Friday night. He had intended to drop Lauren Bessette off
at Martha's Vineyard, then fly on to Hyannis P ort for the Saturday
wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family members, anxious to avoid having a spectacle made
of John Kennedy's final resting place, are making preparations for
him to be buried at sea in a Navy ceremony, according to a family
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided after much internal debate to hold an
intimate memorial service, which will be closed to the press. The
service will be held at a Roman Catholic Church that Kennedy's late
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, attended, the Church of St.
Thomas More in Manhattan's. The stone church seats just 350.
</P>
<P>
   The service for Kennedy and his wife will be held Friday at 11
a.m. The White House said President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton will attend.
</P>
<P>
   A candelight memorial service for Lauren Bessette will be held
on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Christopher C. Murray, the Navy's superintendent of
diving, said in an interview that Kennedy's body was in the largest
of several pieces of wreckage found near each other. Murray said
the divers made the recover in difficult conditions; visibility was
less than eight feet, the current was strong and the ocean floor
was littered with rocks and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who descended in elevator cages, were attached to
the Grasp by oxygen and radio lines, and other divers stood by on
the ship in case one of those beneath got hurt or tangled in the
wreckage. Now that the bodies have been removed, divers will use
straps and cables to form slings around the pieces of plane before
hoisting them on the Grasp's boom, which can lift 40 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members
since the plane was reported missing, said on Wednesday he had
authorized a continuation of the unusually long search, which has
been criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national
lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained
in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few
more days,'' Clinton said Wednesday afternoon during a news
conference on other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the
right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the official announcement by the National
Transportation Safety Board, ``a large portion of the fuselage''
was discovered at about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's body was identified within three hours. Then in a
45-minute dive that began just before noon, Navy divers located the
other two bodies. On Wednesday afternoon, a second set of divers
recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The debris field, which investigators call the plane's ``splash
point,'' is just off Gay Head, the western tip of Martha's
Vineyard, and very near a private beach that was once owned by Mrs.
Onassis and now belongs to her last surviving child, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Kennedy's plane was plunging at 5,000
feet per minute just before radar contact was lost Friday night,
and pilots and aviation authorities said the description that has
been provided seems to indicate a ``graveyard spiral,'' a corkscrew
descent in which the pilot becomes disoriented and loses control.

   The death of Kennedy, who grew up before the nation from a rich
scion to a ruggedly glamorous entrepreneur, has provoked an
outpouring of mourning and nostalgia for America's best-known
political family. As crowds thronged the Kennedys' home in New York
and anyplace with a Kennedy connection, the John F. Kennedy Hyannis
Museum, operated by the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, added an
easel on Wednesday afternoon featuring a quote from President
Kennedy, who was assassinated when his son was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tied to the ocean,'' Kennedy said in 1962 at a dinner
celebrating America's Cup. ``When we go back to the sea, whether it
is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence we came.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy destroyer, the U.S.S. Briscoe, which had been training in
the area, moved toward Cape Cod on Wednesday in case the family
decides to hold the funeral ceremony at sea. A Navy official said
``commitment at sea,'' as the ceremony is known, is typically
performed for active or retired members of the service, and their
dependents. But Navy regulations allow for the service to be
performed for ``notable service or outstanding contributions to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Burial at sea is a ritual that extends back to the ancient
Greeks, who dropped a coin in the mouth of the deceased for the
toll at the River Styx. Paul L. Stillwell, the director of history
at the Naval Institute, a private educational organization, said
the service has become more rare now that bodies can be airlifted
off ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   For the ceremony, the body traditionally was sewn into sailcloth
and weighted by a cannonball. The service also can be performed
with a coffin. Either way, the body is put on a board and tipped
into the sea, to the accompaniment of three rifle volleys. With a
cremation, the ashes are allowed to blow off the stern of the ship,
Stillwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board. said its investigation
into the crash will continue for six to nine more months. James
Hall, the chairman, said the agency will make no other comment
until all memorial and funeral services are complete.
