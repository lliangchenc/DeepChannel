KENNEDY REFUSED INSTRUCTOR'S OFFER TO FLY ON FATAL NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   One of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him
unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night,
offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash. But
Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor
told the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in
the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was
released Thursday. The report concludes that, during the flight
from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in
the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his
airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her
sister.
</P>
<P>
   The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general
aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the
accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot,
passengers, or persons interviewed by name. But appended to the
report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's
skills as a pilot and his training.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown
his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _
about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted
at the island airport. The instructor told investigators that
Kennedy ``seemed competent . . . but may have had difficulty
performing additional tasks under such conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that
Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an
instructor on board. And he said he believed at the time that
Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to
be tested on flying by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt
comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight
operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather
conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the
accident. The instructor further stated that he had talked to the
pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the
accident flight. He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he
wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news
stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's
failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over
water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night.''
</P>
<P>
   Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur
when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the
plane is headed. The pilot may believe the plane is flying with
wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that
the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error
caused the crash. No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found
after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven
miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, had no comment on
the report, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes
Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _
he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the
two years before the crash. But, also in keeping with his level of
experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could
find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that
would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only
cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have
had to rely on the night of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation
Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a
score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade. And in
April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had
enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license)
in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had
completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until
lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity
with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from
air-traffic controllers. It took him four attempts to pass that
section.
</P>
<P>
   The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument
flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the
report. ``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had
trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was
normal for the pilot's level of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he
bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at
night. Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey,
where the plane was based, and they included several flights from
Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which
required the use of instruments to land. Kennedy handled that feat,
according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder
pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in
several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly
an hour in instrument conditions. An unspecified amount of that
flight time was in the Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in
the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the
airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one
selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on
again. In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into
a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane
made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate
either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that
night. The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed
all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need
to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the
Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette. John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to
continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global
positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard. ``He
looked down and `there was nothing to see. There was no horizon, no
light. . . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it
was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of
the island. . . . I thought the island might have suffered a power
failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying. And as the
pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to
use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by
observations of the horizon or the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy
may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air
traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace
around busy airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the
Westchester County Airport. An American Airlines Fokker 100 was
preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to
an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to
anybody.'' The planes were close enough that the on-board traffic
collision avoidance system sounded an alert on the American
Airlines plane. No course correction was required and the American
plane landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB report indicates that a review of radar data correlated
the unknown aircraft with the track of Kennedy's final flight.
