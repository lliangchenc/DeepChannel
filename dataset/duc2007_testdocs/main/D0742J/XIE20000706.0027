<HEADLINE> U.S. Board Concludes Pilot Error Caused Kennedy Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a final report issued Thursday on last year's July 19 crash
of the aircraft near Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, the
United States,the NTSB said Kennedy, son of the late U.S.
president, had become disorientated during a descent over water at
night.
</P>
<P>
Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,
and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to
maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at
night," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused
by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of
the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's
surface, it added.
</P>
<P>
This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of
fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration report.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they could not find any mechanical problems
with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, and autopsies on all three
victims found no abnormalities.
