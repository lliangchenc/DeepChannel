<P>
   Just after dusk on Friday, John F. Kennedy Jr., hobbled by a
broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in
Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into
the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight
to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's
Vineyard. His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister,
Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
   The engine turned. The instruments came to life. Within minutes,
the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed
into the hazy evening sky.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen it since.
</P>
<P>
   Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of
decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft
without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor
accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an
airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against
the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way
just off Aquinnah, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid
descent at 9:38 p.m. Friday, about an hour into his flight and
about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport. Sunday,
searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior;
on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas
luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the
plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least
one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed
in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second
owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for
$300,000. ``I used it several times and it worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a
pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed
light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29
seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off
Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane
disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the
very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a
half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the
south coast of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was
delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough,
and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated
Press quoted a friend as saying. But family friends told the Globe
they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a
standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight
rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly
by what they can see.
</P>
<P>
   As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged
through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _
fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane
lifted off. They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga
by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on
a solo flight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday
that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his
broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling
the plane's rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the
plane. But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight
plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving
New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting
the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for
a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance
policy, not an air traffic control document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue
earlier?'' he said. ``Yes, it probably would have.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey,
Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's
Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent. Over
the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It then disappeared from all radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the
Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was
overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was
scheduled to leave at 10 p.m. Friday, and the airport's runway
lights were dimmed. To brighten them, an approaching pilot must
tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the
microphone five times in five seconds, or seven times in seven
seconds to reach their maximum wattage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane's sudden drop, the radar tapes from the FAA
facility used to guide planes in and out of T.F. Green Airport
airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane
was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the
controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in
the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that
airplane. The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that
this happened,'' Barte said. ``Maybe in five more minutes he would
have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent,
but this rate of descent was not normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was there
something wrong with the plane, or with the pilot? Because that is
all there is.''
