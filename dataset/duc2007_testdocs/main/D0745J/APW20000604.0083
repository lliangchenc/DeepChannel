<HEADLINE> Bailey Stopped Simpson Lie Test  </HEADLINE>

   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Days after O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and a man
were stabbed to death, the football star underwent a polygraph test
that F. Lee Bailey says he stopped because it was not going well.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Friday, during testimony in a Florida courtroom
where his license to practice law is being challenged, that shortly
after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense
attorney Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who has said he is an expert on polygraph examinations,
said Shapiro wanted his advice about a polygraph test of Simpson in
progress that was not going well.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too
emotional a time for Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said shut the test down, you have to let him settle down,''
said Bailey, who was eventually part of Simpson's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he advised Shapiro that if Simpson was to take a
polygraph examination it should only include questions about
Goldman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Shapiro took the test results and no one has seen
them since. He said Shapiro has said he doesn't have the test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey did not elaborate further on the polygraph episode.
Messages left for Shapiro Sunday afternoon were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has said he never took a polygraph test, but was hooked
up to the machine to see how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil case against Simpson, lawyers for the Goldman
family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the deaths but the
civil jury found him liable for the crimes. He was ordered to pay
$33.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting of the polygraph incident in the Simpson case
came in Bailey's lengthy accounting of how his time was spent
defending another client, international drug trafficker Claude
Duboc. Bailey is accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of
stock Duboc held in a pharmaceutical company to pay Bailey's legal
expenses.
