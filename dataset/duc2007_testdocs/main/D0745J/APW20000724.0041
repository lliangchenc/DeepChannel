<HEADLINE> Walters Nixes OJ Simpson Appearance  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Loud cheers from a studio audience greeted
Barbara Walters' announcement Monday that she has canceled a
scheduled appearance by O.J. Simpson this week on her syndicated
talk show, ''The View.''
</P>
<P>
   Several viewers, members of the show's production staff and all
four of her co-hosts had told her they were uncomfortable having
Simpson as a guest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Simpson will not appear on our program,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's appearance, scheduled for Wednesday, was to promote
his participation in a two-hour Internet ''chat'' session on
Thursday where members of the public can pay a fee to ask him
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was
found liable in a subsequent civil trial for the 1994 deaths of his
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. He was
ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she and her co-executive producer, Bill Geddie,
made the decision to cancel the booking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although on 'The View' Bill Geddie and I encourage differences
of opinion among us -- we can't stop it and indeed we love it --
there was more serious concern about having Mr. Simpson on the
program from all of you at this table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was surrounded by her co-hosts, Meredith Vieira, Joy Behar,
Star Jones and Lisa Ling. Vieira joined in the audience's cheers by
pounding the table after Walters' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Behar chose to make a joke: ''As Johnnie Cochran says, if the
guy's a schnook, you must unbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is making other television appearances ahead of his
Internet ''chat'' session, including interviews Tuesday on NBC's
''Today'' and with Paula Zahn on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox News Channel spokesman said Simpson's representatives
asked to see questions they would be asked on the show in advance
but were refused.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's father, Fred, went on Fox News Channel last week to
encourage television networks not to have Simpson as a guest.
