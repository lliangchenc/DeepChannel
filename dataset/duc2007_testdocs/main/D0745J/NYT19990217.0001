   LOS ANGELES -- O.J. Simpson's Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched
$230,000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the
families of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount raised by the sale of 74 items was $430,000,
but the families of the two slaying victims will receive only about
$382,000 once auction house fees and other costs are subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount collected today won't even put a scratch in the
$33.5 million judgment,'' said attorney Michael D. Myers, the state
court receiver appointed to oversee the liquidation of Simpson's
property.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was intended to partially satisfy the civil judgment
owed by Simpson to the families of Goldman and his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   A civil jury held Simpson liable for their stabbing deaths in
February 1997, two years after Simpson was acquitted by a criminal
jury on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer of the Heisman Trophy, an East Coast collector, did
not want to be identified, said officials with the Butterfield and
Butterfield auction house in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the Heisman started at $75,000 and quickly rose
above $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cohen of Cleveland came close to getting the trophy with a
bid of $220,000, but decided to hold off when he realized that the
East Coast collector would top his bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to put it in my house and let it collect dust
and say, ``God! I'm a Heisman Trophy winner,'' said Cohen, a real
estate developer who last played football in the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Another private collector, Randy Burkett, said he also wanted a
Heisman, but did not want to spend more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bidding went by us in a shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett did spend about $10,000 on several trophies and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of history. We just wanted a piece of it,'' said
Burkett who came from Amarillo, Texas, for the auction of items
that were seized from Simpson's Brentwood estate in March 1997 by
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The most coveted item and the last to be auctioned was the
Heisman Memorial Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a
senior at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statute, the most prestigious award in college
football, is the only one ever auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the overall result (of the auction),''
said Ira M. Friedman, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown
Simpson. ``Anything is better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Brown Simpson's estate is expected to receive one third
of the auction proceeds, while Goldman's family should receive
two-thirds, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people including a crush of media attended the
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they did not know if O.J. Simpson had a
representative there.
</P>
<P>
   The professional football Hall of Fame Award that had been
presented to Simpson went at auction for $10,000 to representatives
of a computer Web site who said they plan to destroy the
certificate and some Simpson football jerseys on Wednesday to
protest failings in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to destroy this O.J. Simpson property on the steps
of the L.A. (Criminal) Courthouse (Wednesday) at noon,'' said Bob
Enyart, a representative of the Web site, shadowgov.com of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Enyart said the group, which spent $4,750 for two football
jerseys, had planned for two weeks to buy and destroy these items.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mohr, 43, of North Hollywood said it appeared many people
were drawn to the auction by morbid curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of people who bid from the heart and not the
mind,'' said Mohr, a U.S. Postal Service worker and collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a hold of O.J., but you can stand next to O.J.'s
Heisman,'' Mohr said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some of the items went for far more than their estimated
value, especially the football jerseys and golf bags.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpson golf bags with clubs went on average for about
$2,200.
</P>
<P>
   A simple white football jersey with red stripes and the number
32 estimated to be worth at least $400 went for $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   A Hall of Fame commemorative football valued at $200 to $300
went for $2,250.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artwork also brought high bids.
</P>
<P>
   A Tiffany-style leaded glass lamp shade valued at $600 to $900
went for $7,000.
