	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nicole Brown Simpson's sister and her lawyer  
said Monday they are asking the state attorney general to 
investigate the possibility of filing perjury charges against O.J. 
Simpson before a statute of limitations runs out in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Brown and attorney Gloria Allred said Los Angeles County  
District Attorney Gil Garcetti has taken no action on similar 
requests made to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Allred and Brown said that Simpson lied during his civil trial  
when he testified that he never hit, struck slapped or kicked his 
late wife. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney's spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin would say only  
that ``the matter is still under investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths  
of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay 
$33.5 million in damages. In an earlier criminal trial he was 
acquitted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson could not be reached by telephone for comment.
