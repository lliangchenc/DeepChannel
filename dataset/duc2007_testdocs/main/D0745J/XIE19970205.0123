WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A civil jury found former
American football star O.J. Simpson liable for the wrongful death
of his ex-wife and her friend, according to television report from
Santa Monica, California on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 49, was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal
trial for the slashing murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson
and her friend Ronald Goldman, but the victims' relatives filed a
civil wrongful death suit against him, seeking monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
The jury ordered him to pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars in
compensatory damages and will return Thursday to decide whether to
award millions more in punitive damages.
</P>

Earlier Tuesday, the jury in the wrongful death suit was read
back statements by several witnesses, including testimony
pertaining to Simpson's whereabouts on the evening of June 12
1994, when Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were killed outside
her home.
