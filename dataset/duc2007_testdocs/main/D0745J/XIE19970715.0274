<HEADLINE> O.J. Simpson's Dream House Sold for $2.63 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former football star O.J.
Simpson's house was sold at auction today for 2.63 million U.S.
dollars to the bank that had foreclosed on it.
</P>
<P>
The sale was held outside the courthouse in Los Angeles
suburban Norwalk. Bidding opened at 1,875,000 dollars. Patrick
Dobiesz, representing lender Hawthorne Savings, opened the
bidding. Four times, another bidder added one dollar to the pot.
</P>
<P>
By buying the property, Hawthorne Savings can sell it privately
for a much higher price. It also eliminates any excess money that
would have been used to pay part of a 33.5 million dollars civil
judgment against Simpson.
</P>
<P>
Although Simpson was acquitted of murder during a criminal
trial, he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death
trial that ended earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The 6,200-square-foot home in Los Angeles' wealthy Brentwood
section, which Simpson has lived in for 20 years, has six baths, a
tennis court, waterfalls and an Olympic-size swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how quickly Simpson would have to move out. He
said he will remain in the home with his two youngest children for
a while, hoping to find another residence in Brentwood by this
fall.
