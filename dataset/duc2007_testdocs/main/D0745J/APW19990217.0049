	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson memorabilia went up in flames to  
a chorus of cheers and boos Wednesday, a day after it was sold at 
auction to help pay off the $33.5 million judgment he owes in the 
deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two No. 32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of  
Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were 
smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized 
by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased $16,000 worth of 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction Tuesday raised $430,000, including $255,500 for  
Simpson's Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are destroying O.J. Simpson's property in front of the L.A.  
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying 
justice before our very eyes,'' protest organizer Bob Enyart of 
Denver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The destruction was criticized by some spectators at the  
downtown courthouse and by Simpson, who said it was a waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder about the mentality involved in this,'' Simpson said  
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``The guy's 
burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with 
cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred spectators booed and cheered at the destruction  
of the items, which included jerseys from the University of 
Southern California and the National Football League's Buffalo 
Bills and two 1973 ``Lifesaver'' trophies apparently given for 
charity contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman was the auction's big item and was not part of  
Wednesday's demonstration. The winning bid of $255,500 came from an 
anonymous East Coast collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of  
Ms. Simpson and Ronald Goldman's family. A jury made the award in a 
wrongful death lawsuit that followed Simpson's acquittal on 
criminal charges in the 1994 killings. Simpson is appealing the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also auctioned off were football awards, artwork, Tiffany-style  
lamps and a fox fur coat that belonged to Simpson's first wife, 
Marguerite. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports  
memorabilia hasn't been selling well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to have anything to do with O.J.  
Simpson. There's a real sour taste in their mouths,'' said Scott 
Welkowsky, owner of Out of This World Memorabilia in Orange County.
