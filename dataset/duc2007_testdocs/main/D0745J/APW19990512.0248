<HEADLINE> Simpson: No Comment on Custody Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is there an agreement for O.J. Simpson to  
keep custody of his two youngest children? Simpson's lawyer says 
yes. Their grandfather says no. The children's lawyer thinks so, 
and Simpson isn't commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of  
Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at 
the center of a custody battle between their father and their 
mother's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simpson's father, Lou Brown, insisted Tuesday that no  
custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson's 
lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the attorney was discussing it,'' he said.  
``It's supposed to be confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement  
giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson refused to comment and seemed distressed that his lawyer  
was discussing the matter publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what was holding up resolution of the children's custody,  
Brown said, ``It depends on him,'' referring to Simpson and adding: 
``He's out of town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marjorie Fuller, the attorney representing the children, said  
Tuesday she has not been involved in the negotiations but believes 
an agreement is close. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to hang back and let Mr. Simpson and the Browns work  
it out,'' she said. ``But as far as I know, everybody's been 
working real hard on an agreement and it was waiting to be 
signed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown family lawyer, Kimberly Knill, did not return a phone  
call. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who live with Simpson, often visit Brown and his  
wife, Juditha. The Browns lost their first custody suit, but the 
California Supreme Court ruled in February the case could be 
retried. 
</P>
<P>
	Leckie said Monday that everyone agreed ``it's in the best  
interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the 
courts any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of Ms. Simpson and her  
friend Ronald Goldman. But he was held liable in a wrongful death 
lawsuit filed by the Brown and Goldman families, who were awarded 
$33.5 million.
