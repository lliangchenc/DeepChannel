<P>
   UNDATED -- Say two little letters, get a big response --
everything from anger that O.J. Simpson remains in the public eye,
to pride that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J. Simpson's
acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible
for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral
emotions?
</P>
<P>
   Is it Simpson himself? Just this week he's sparked controversy
by appearing on the ``Today'' show to promote his latest venture
(www.askoj.com) -- and by not being a guest on ``The View,'' after
fans of that talk show protested his scheduled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum? Do the news and
entertainment media cover O.J. because the public remains
fascinated, or is the public fascinated because the news and
entertainment media cover him?
</P>
<P>
   Even experts differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored with the subject, and my students are. They yawn
when I bring it up,'' said Frankie Bailey, a University of Albany
specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture. ``I
know the media are still interested. People may just be dragged
along behind the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell M. Hunt disagrees. ``I don't think the case will ever be
NOT interesting,'' said Hunt, director of African-American studies
and an associate sociology professor at University of Southern
California. ``People will always be somewhat titillated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Joshua Meyrowitz, professor of communication at the
University of New Hampshire, it's ``shortcut journalism. That's the
reason why O.J. and others like JonBenet Ramsey and Elian Gonzalez
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's not so much (that) the public is interested,
it's that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured
out how simple it is to report these cases. It doesn't require
research, or understanding of complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the World Wide Web, the 645 members of one O.J.
newsgroup (alt.fan.oj-simpson) still debate, every day, the
minutiae of his guilt or innocence. They even have labels for their
split, the ``No-J's'' and the ``Pro-J's.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,272 topics include everything from the gruesome (``Nicole,
whose trachea was severed, did not even aspirate a single drop of
blood...'') to the mundane (``Kato saw the golf bag about 10:55
p.m. outside the front door, when Simpson was still in the
house...'')
</P>
<P>
   One member is Betty Parker, 60, a General Motors retiree in
Trenton, N.J. She's pondered, or researched, or written on, or read
about the case ``from Day One,'' she said, and continues to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, ``I didn't even like O.J.,'' Parker said. ``But I
started watching, and I found myself thinking, `That's strange,'''
about so many details.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody glove, for instance. ``Why would a killer leave that
behind at the scene?'' Or Simpson's injured finger. ``If he was in
a life-and-death struggle he would have practically sliced it off,
but it was just a tiny cut.''
</P>
<P>
   For Parker, such nagging questions never have been answered, and
in their wake is a different America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African American, I feel my people are being punished
for taking this (innocent) position,'' she said. ``There are people
in board rooms making decisions, who are still embittered over the
O.J. Simpson verdict. And those decisions are their retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's Hunt, author of ``O.J. Simpson Facts and Fictions: News
Rituals in the Construction of Reality,'' agreed that race is a
prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point. ``I think the case
might be seen as a giant Rorschach test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trials forced America to consider three hot-button topics
simultaneously, Hunt said:
</P>
<P>
   -- Race, as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gender, with the allegations of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   -- And class, with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a ``dream
team'' of attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are issues we continue to wrestle with,'' Hunt
added.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, there's disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I encounter, the subject of O.J. just never comes
up,'' said Bailey from the University of Albany. ``I think by this
time, most people have reached their own conclusions about the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing isn't in dispute: that O.J. Simpson is a permanent
fixture in American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outspoken, he continues to talk about it,'' Bailey said.
``As an academic, I'll be interested to see how many hits he gets
on his new Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Simpson ever be able to stroll down a street and not evoke
a response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely not,'' Hunt said. ``I just can't see it. Until
he dies, he'll be a symbol of where we are as a society.''
