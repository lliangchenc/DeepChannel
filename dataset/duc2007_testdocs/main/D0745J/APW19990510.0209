<HEADLINE> Simpson Will Keep His Children </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson will keep custody of his two  
young children in a settlement with the parents of his slain 
ex-wife, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which still requires the signatures of Lou and  
Juditha Brown, heads off a second trial over the custody of 
13-year-old Sydney and Justin, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the best interest of the children that this not be  
dragged out through the courts any further,'' said Simpson attorney 
Bernard Leckie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have long fought Simpson over custody of the  
children, but Leckie said Simpson is now on good terms with his 
children's grandparents and they're closely involved in their 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns and Simpson are getting along better now,'' Leckie  
said. ``They sit together at the children's athletic events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home Monday, Simpson refused to comment. Calls to the  
Browns were unreturned and their lawyer could not be located. The 
lawyer representing the children also did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody  
case could go back to court for a second trial because a judge had 
failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Simpson's former 
wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted in criminal court but held liable for the  
deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldman's 
family $33.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The custody agreement comes nearly five years after Ms. Simpson  
and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson spent a year in jail before he was acquitted. During  
that year, the Browns had custody of the two children. When Simpson 
was freed the children moved in with him but the Browns decided to 
sue for permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge awarded custody to Simpson in 1996, but the Browns  
appealed the decision.
