MICROSOFT TO OFFER REBUTTAL   ON IBM EXECUTIVE'S CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp. is expected to
introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by
an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker
a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM
agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system,
OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager
who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business,
is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the
government. In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that
Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of
Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement
to drop OS/2 from its machines. He specifically mentioned the
proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's
relationship with IBM's P.C. business.
</P>
<P>
   But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday
that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a
lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2
from its PC's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in
1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between
the two companies. That effort, he said, included drafting a
document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's
software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included
language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM
from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other
divisions of IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in
court during the cross-examination of Norris. But Mark Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to
show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions
leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though
complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try
to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2. Yes, we have documents that
we believe show that.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would
have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly
because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according
to Baber.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a
crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the
Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it
charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating
system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over
competing software. Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license
agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that
IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM
rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp. He also
testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying
$9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45
for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low
because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in
software, IBM had shared in the development costs. Compaq's price
for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several
dollars lower than IBM's price. But that, he insisted, was mainly
because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which
included providing customer support for Windows and writing
software to make printers and other hardware work well with
Windows.
