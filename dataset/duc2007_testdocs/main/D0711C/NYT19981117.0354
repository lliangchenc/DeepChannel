CALIFORNIA RULING IS A SETBACK FOR MICROSOFT

   Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged
by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal
setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California
ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that
violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private
law suit in California, will have on the government's case is
uncertain. But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit
do include the practices that are at the heart of the
breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _
namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet
programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the
antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal
practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its
tight grip on the market for personal computer software. If Sun's
Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could
pose a serious challenge to Microsoft. And in the California case,
Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language,
Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S. District Court in San Jose
ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make
its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it
had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement
with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the
spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is
part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to
monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It helps the
atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond
that what the effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and
the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would
have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan,
who is now at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to
have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _
though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of
trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of
Internet software standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no
business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Microsoft does not have to pull
products out of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it
clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the
antitrust case.''
