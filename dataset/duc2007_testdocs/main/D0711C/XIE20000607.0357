<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Judge Orders Microsoft Split in Two EDS-Updates with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge ordered
Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to
correct antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along
with the government recommendation that the software giant be
split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another
that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software
and Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust
penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&AMP;T agreed to
spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling
to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order
amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said,
citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the
1990s that preceded the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling
that, as expected, the company would appeal. "We have a very
strong appeal," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
Since its 1975 founding, Microsoft has grown to become the
world's most valuable software company with annual revenues of
over 20 billion U.S. dollars a year. With 60 foreign offices and
its software used around the world, a breakup would eventually
affect computer users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department and 17 of the states that sued
Microsoft proposed the split after Jackson concluded on April 3
that the firm violated U.S. antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the
Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers,
from being used to force companies and consumers to use other
Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
Breakup of the company could also encourage development of
alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like
Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which expects to win on appeal, says a breakup would
harm consumers by preventing it from developing integrated
products.
</P>
<P>
The company's appeal could bypass the normal appeals court
process and go straight to the Supreme Court under a mechanism
available in major antitrust cases. But several legal experts said
they believed the high court would decline to receive the case on
an expedited basis.
