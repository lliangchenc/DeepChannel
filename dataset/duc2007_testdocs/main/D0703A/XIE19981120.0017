PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- France has already struck one
billion coins of the European single currency euro, which will be

Besides France, only Finland, Belgium and Spain have begun
their production of the euros, but not as much as France, said AFP

euro, while other European nations which will join euro are due to
begin producing the coin next year.
