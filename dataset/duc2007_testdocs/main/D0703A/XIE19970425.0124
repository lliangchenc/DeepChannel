<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes New Currency Code for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today welcomed the decision
by the Maintenance Agency for ISO 4217, the body responsible for
the issuance of currency codes, to attribute the code "EUR" to the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
This new code has been issued to allow progress with the
technical preparations for the European single currency, scheduled
to be launched on January 1, 1999, said a press release issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
The code is intended for use in any application of trade,
commerce and banking which is based on uniform, internationally
agreed representations of currencies.
</P>
<P>
It will allow currency users to identify the new currency
easily. The early attribution of the currency code will help
economic agents, in particular financial institutions, in their
preparatory work for the introduction of the single currency.
