	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obese women are six times more likely than  
thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their 
arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing 
heart disease, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the findings are verified, they suggest scientists should  
study whether the aspirin some heart patients take might also help 
overweight people reduce their chances of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease:  
The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high 
cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and 
other cardiovascular risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another  
risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently  
discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years 
and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what causes the subtle inflammation. One theory has  
been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests 
that antibiotics may help fight heart disease. On the other hand, 
doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at 
high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood -- and 
aspirin also reduces inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves  
can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes 
inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a  
U.S. database of 16,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a  
blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP levels 
skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases 
like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease. But lower levels, 
between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the 
ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to  
have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference  
Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were 
much more overweight than men studied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday,  
before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here. If 
verified, ``it could have quite an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visser, a weight specialist at Amsterdam's Vrije University,  
statistically controlled for other diseases that might have caused 
the study participants' CRP levels to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under  
age 40. Even ``at a young age, when you're obese there's this 
inflammation, and we know it's bad for you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study isn't proof that obesity inflames people's arteries,  
cautioned Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, 
which funded the research. But the federal agency is intrigued 
enough that it is funding more research into the link -- and probing 
whether obesity-caused inflammation might have ramifications for 
other diseases, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes  
CRP levels to drop immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or  
any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, 
could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions 
that nobody has tested that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do if you're obese is lose weight instead of  
hitting the aspirin bottle,'' she cautioned.
