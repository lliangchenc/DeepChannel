EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us, but
the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is
enlightening. With Food in the News, The Chronicle's Food staff
aims to change that. This round-up column will make practical sense
of the latest nutrition-related studies _ as well as offering
offbeat but tantalizing snippets of other food news to put on your

 Food In The News: Giant Food Portions Equal Giant People   By Kim Severson 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The culprit behind America's weight problem may
not be what we eat but how much we eat.
<P>
   Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the
nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a
leading cause of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much
higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a
registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer
Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link
between diet and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from
an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the
average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002. If
exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of
15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major reason people are getting bigger,'' Polk says, ``is
that their servings have gotten larger, and commercial food
portions are a major culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   French fries from McDonald's offer a clear example of the
phenomenon. An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26
grams of fat. When the company began selling french fries in the
1950s, a small order _ the only one available _ had 220 calories
and 12 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also  &LR; recently &LR;  surveyed croissants &LR; , quesadillas &LR; 
and bagels, popular  &LR; American &LR;  foods adopted from other countries.
In each case, the item grew in size and calories when it was
adapted for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an
ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference. The typical
American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures
181/2 inches. And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar
and fat, Polk says.
</P>
<P>
   The bagel, seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast
pastries, has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe. Even in
its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its
European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces. But today some bagels
have more than doubled in size. National bagel-maker Lender offers
a 41/2-ounce ``Big and Crusty'' bagel; Dunkin Donuts' plain bagel
is four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   And people rarely eat bagels plain. Adding fat-laden spreads
like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content. And
the bigger the bagel, the more spread it can take.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their
immigration from Mexico, Polk says. Small corn tortillas filled
with potato, cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico, and
cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour
tortilla filled with cheese. Polk estimates the typical
American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70
grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In other studies, nutritionists and researchers are nudging
out the concept of ``bad foods'' like soda and fat in favor of
focusing on the huge portion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers
from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that
overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared,
carbonated soft drinks than than children who weren't overweight,
and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood
obesity, then we should point our fingers at the real culprits _
huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity,'' says
Maureen Storey of the &LR; Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to eliminate certain foods isn't a practical way to help
children or adults lose weight, she says. ``We should get over this
good food-bad food silliness and move on.''
