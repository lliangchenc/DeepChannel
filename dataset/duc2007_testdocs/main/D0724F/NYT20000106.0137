   WASHINGTON _ Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop
launched an Internet site Thursday to help overweight people ``lose
weight in a healthy manner and keep off the pounds for good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when obesity is escalating to epidemic levels, it is
important to reach Americans with solution-oriented information on
weight control,'' Koop said at a news copnference to unveil the
Shape Up and Drop 10 site (www.shapeup.org).
</P>
<P>
   The number of obese Americans has more than tripled since 1991
to 90 million, and recent estimates suggest that obesity-related
diseases may cost Americans more than $100 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   For a registration fee of $15 and $10 a week thereafter, adults
18 and over can join the pay-as-you-go program and select a plan
that fits their needs. It allows individuals to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Set personal weight management goals, including weight loss or
prevention of weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose each day's meal and snack from four types of diets _
basic, non-dairy, lacto-ovo or vegan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Control calories both at home and when eating out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose from five different physical activity plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine each week what weight management challenges need to
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds from Shape Up and Drop 10 will support Shape Up
America, a non-profit nationwide network founded by Koop that
developed the site, and organizations representing the leading
associations in the field of medicine, public health and physical
activity. Whatever's left over will be used to underwrite weight
loss programs, said Dr. Barbara J. Moore, president of Shape Up
America.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said people may get better results with Shape Up and Drop
10 than they might get with their personal physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their personal physicians spend only eight minutes with them
(per visit), which is not enough time,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that because physicians can charge as much as $150 per
visit, people can't afford to visit their doctors weekly for weight
loss tips.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the surgeon general's office in 1989, Koop has
been involved in another Internet venture, drkoop.com, which aides
say helps people manage their personal health with comprehensive,
trustworthy information. Koop is also the Elizabeth DeCamp McInerny
professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

<P>
   At the same news conference Thursday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the
District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, promoted
her legislation to encourage healthy diets and physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said her $15 million Lifelong Improvements in Food and
Exercise (LIFE) Act, introduced in Congress late last year, is
designed to address the 300,000 cases of preventable disease
estimated to result each year from unhealthy diets and physical
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying theme of the bill is that unhealthy lifestyles
have gained such a foothold in every part of the country that only
major intervention can affect existing runaway patterns in time,''
Norton said.
