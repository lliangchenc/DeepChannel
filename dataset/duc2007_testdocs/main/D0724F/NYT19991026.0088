   LOS ANGELES _ Americans are gobbling down more calories than
ever, resulting in a 50 percent increase in the nation's obesity
rate, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, the more highly educated and Hispanics are leading
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that
17.9 percent of Americans are obese. In 1991 the proportion was 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15
percent, compared with just four states in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines define obesity as being at least 30 percent
above ideal weight. For example, a 5-foot-9-inch person who weighs
more than 220 pounds is considered obese.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said the results of the study, based on a large
telephone survey of more than 100,000 people, are further evidence
that more effort must go into public health campaigns to combat
poor eating habits and encourage physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is linked to many chronic and life-threatening diseases,
including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine in Medford,
Mass., reported Monday that 280,000 deaths a year can be attributed
to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC data, to be published in Wednesday's edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that obesity
was increasing fastest among 18- to 29-year-olds, people with
college educations and people of Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not find any significant changes in the rates of
physical activity, indicating that overeating was the cause of most
of the increase in weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the same issue of the medical journal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston report that young
people who ate more fiber were less likely to be obese and have
high blood pressure and high levels of bad cholesterol. Fiber
outstripped lower fat intake as being correlated with those
positive health results.
</P>
<P>
   _ A researcher from Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York
found that injections of the hormone leptin increased weight loss
for both obese and lean subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Like other tests of leptin, which is linked to appetite
regulation, the studies did not demonstrate a dramatic difference,
although users did lose more than those who received injections of
a placebo. At the highest doses, obese patients lost an average of
15.6 pounds after 24 weeks. They were also on a diet designed to
give them 500 fewer calories per day than they needed to maintain
their normal weight.
