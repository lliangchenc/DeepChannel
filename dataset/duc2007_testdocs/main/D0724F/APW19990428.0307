<HEADLINE> Obesity Risks Decline With Age </HEADLINE>

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as  
it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are similar to those in a study reported last year  
that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 
75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people 
are extremely obese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get  
older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor 
decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the 
University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the 
latest study. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said the findings are not that meaningful.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this  
study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr. 
JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and  
women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an 
average of 14.8 years. The patients, who were referred to an 
obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and 
body mass index. 
</P>
<P>
	Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard  
way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare 
the girth of people of different heights. BMI is body fat in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared. 
</P>
<P>
	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of  
Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 
and above is obese. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese  
person -- with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or 
younger. Moderately obese men and women -- with a BMI between 32 and 
40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is  
a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density 
declines with age. They also noted that the study participants were 
recruited rather than randomly selected.
