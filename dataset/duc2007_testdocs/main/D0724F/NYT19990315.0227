   An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading
researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are
safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.
</P>
<P>
   In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful
of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could
point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their
poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
</P>
<P>
   With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust,
many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from
work going on at a frantic pace _ and amid much secrecy _ in
biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the
body's weight control system.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of
genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty
foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in
weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is
going to work'' to stem the soaring obesity epidemic, says David
West, a genetics researcher at Parke-Davis Laboratories in
Alamedia, Calif. ``We've been trying to change peoples' dietary
habits for years and years, but we all like high-fat food, and our
work style is such that many of us have sedentary jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping
people lose weight and keep it off. What's more promising, say West
and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic
switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and
energy in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the
investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily
invested in obesity gene research.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a
mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when
eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
</P>
<P>
   The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's
involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much
fat the body stores. The discovery brings to over a dozen the
number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years
that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects
the mice against diet-induced obesity. But researchers are
confident they will in time be able to trace the different
biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be
able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be
the important regulatory devices in this system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene
is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity
drug development,'' Dr. Karen Moore, Millennium's director of
genetic systems said when making the announcement last week. ``In
developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function
rather than to try to increase it,
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the
obesity research field. Not only does it suggest that similar genes
in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay
thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide
clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require
the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
</P>
<P>
   Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that
simple to pick apart the human weight control system. ``The
majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would
explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large
number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in
combination with environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's
health _ some 55 percent, or 97 million _ of Americans are
overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was
touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New
York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a
gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to
be obese.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food
intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th
person. Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps
many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their
brains fail to signal them to stop eating. So, the reasoning went,
give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and
cause them to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc., in California,
was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical
trials. Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although
the compound has worked for some of the volunteers. Moreover, it's
been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin:
it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting
to the right receiving station.
</P>
<P>
   Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number
of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight
and energy balance. Each of these gene alterations provide clues to
how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough,
because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says
Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the
University of California in Davis.
</P>
<P>
   How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the
market is anybody's guess. ``We don't know the final chapter _
we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the
genes _ we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy
group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make
obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields
dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease
of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of
compassion'' for the overweight.
