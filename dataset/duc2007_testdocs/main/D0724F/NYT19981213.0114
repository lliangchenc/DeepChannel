   NEW YORK _ On a recent Friday, Tyshon Young, 13, and a
nutritionist strolled the aisles at Fairway in Harlem for a little
comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a box of butter cookies. She pointed to graham
crackers. He picked out frosted flakes. She said Special K was a
better choice. He picked ice cream. She told him to get the low-fat
brand. He wanted a mango. She said he could only have half of one,
once or twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they made their way to the dairy section, Tyshon
turned defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cheese,'' he said, pointing to a package of sliced
American. ``I usually eat a whole pack of crackers, about four or
five slices of cheese, and a drink, like fruit punch.''
</P>
<P>
   High-fat, high-carbohydrate snacks like that have made Tyshon
obese, which has triggered a form of diabetes once considered rare
among people his age. The trip to the grocery store was part of an
elaborate effort to coax him into a new regimen of exercise and
healthy eating that could save his life.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 6 inches and 216 pounds, Tyshon represents an alarming
new health trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters
with Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an
incurable and progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney
failure, blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead
to amputation. Doctors long believed the disease occurred only
during middle age or later.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have not been any national surveys documenting
the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale
studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the
last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say
they have observed similar trends among their own patients. In the
last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the
American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we were teaching medical students that you
didn't see this disease in people under 40, and now we're seeing it
in people under 10,'' said Dr. Robin Goland, co-director of the
Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, which opened in October at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in Manhattan. Dr.
Goland said Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 10 percent to 20
percent of the center's new pediatric patients, compared with less
than 4 percent in the hospital's clinics five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the numbers we're starting to see,'' Goland said, ``this
could be the beginning of an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Children with Type 2 diabetes look a lot like their adult
counterparts. Most are African-American and Hispanic, with a
particularly high rate found among children of Mexican descent.
Most of the Type 2 children have close relatives with the disease,
and almost all are obese.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, doctors said, the spiraling rate of childhood obesity
in America _ declared an epidemic last month by the U.S. Surgeon
General, David Satcher _ is the most significant factor in the
rising numbers of children with this form of diabetes. A common
definition of obesity is when a child's weight exceeds 20 percent
of ideal weight, based on age, height and frame.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent statistics from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the number of obese children has
doubled in the last two decades. One in five children in America is
overweight, researchers found. Poor, minority children, who often
eat a lot of junk food and have few neighborhood recreation
programs, are at greatest risk, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity, by itself, does not always lead to diabetes, doctors
say, but it is a major risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make someone a diabetic, then make them
obese,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, head of molecular genetics at
Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2
diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of
the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care
physicians. Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct
diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the
sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States,
results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.
Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or
juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known
reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose
use. These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest
of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting
their sugar intake.
</P>
<P>
   In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces
insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it. Many
people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the
disease because it can occur in the body for years without
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however,
life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels,
can develop within 10 years to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we
aren't looking for it,'' Goland said, ``then we are going to start
seeing complications in people in their 20s that we would normally
associate with people in their 60s and 70s.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart
attacks _ complications from Type 2 diabetes. The diabetes has also
caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and
hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson, 5 feet, 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told she had
Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors
suspect she probably had the disease for years. The delayed
diagnosis, doctors said, likely contributed to her health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got old too fast,'' said Ms. Wilson, the mother of two
daughters. ``My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me.''

</P>
<P>
   Like adults with Type 2, many children with the disease can
control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet
modification. Eventually, however, most people require oral
medication and insulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are children who likely would have developed the disease
at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it
out early,'' said Dr. Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research
advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. ``Losing
weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2
diabetes. Often they have parents who work long hours and cannot be
home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods
where fast food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes' home in Queens,
there is a McDonald's and a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to eat at McDonald's every night,'' said her mother,
Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet, 6 inches, weighed
more than 145 pounds. Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first
began gaining weight, the doctors told her the girl would outgrow
the ``baby-fat'' after she passed puberty.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and
began losing bladder control _ common symptoms of adult-onset
diabetes _ and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor. By
adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight
as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to normal
range.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Nuribel started at a new school. Her mother said
her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her
health.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about
her disease. She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes,
Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar in her blood is getting high again,'' Mrs. Reyes
said, crying. ``I worry all the time that one day she is going to
be at school and eat something that will damage one of her
organs.''
</P>
<P>
   Several small studies in cities across the country _ including
Cincinnati and San Antonio _ provided the first data about the rise
in cases like Nuribel's.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study, conducted at a Cincinnati diabetes center by the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, showed that among
their pediatric patients, 16 percent had Type 2 in 1994, compared
to 2 percent to 4 percent prior to 1992. The researchers also found
that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new
diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Kenneth Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the
University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area
report that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes has
increased tenfold in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to maybe see one case a year,'' he said. ``Now we see
one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three
cases a month. It's pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy. In
addition to obesity and a family history of the disease,
researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis
nigricans, dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the
arms or behind the knees. Symptoms of the disease include frequent
urination and chronic thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of
Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these
symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed. He had pains
in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision. But,
his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong
with him. They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him
on Prozac, and urged her to insist that he stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle
cell,'' his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, ``but no one tested
him for diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Nigel, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 250 pounds, began
vomiting two or three times a day. One morning, he could hardly
stand and his vision was completely blurred. Emergency room doctors
discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to 8 times
higher than normal. He spent nearly a week in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter. He takes two insulin shots a
day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores.
Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hope to get the
teen-ager off insulin soon.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of
worries about what lies ahead. ``This disease is probably going to
really mess me up,'' he said. ``Eventually everyone succumbs to the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral
medications and sometimes the same pills are used in children,
however none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric
patients. In the next month, several clinics across the country
will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at Mount Sinai Medical
Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia's medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in October, the Berrie center is different from many
other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists
actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become
educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers
and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff. They make house
calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family
discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating.
And they conduct regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday
afternoon trip with Tyshon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment,
we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,''
Goland said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at
the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin.
At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds. Tyshon, his mother and
his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is off limits to you,'' she said, urging Tyshon to
stick with his new eating habits. ``But you have to eat in
moderation. Small changes can make a big difference.''
