SILENT KILLER: HEPATITIS C SLOWLY DESTROYS LIVER

<P>
   UNDATED - Is the Age of Aquarius is coming back to haunt its
flower children?
</P>
<P>
   Young people who reveled in the hedonism of the 1960s and '70s
are discovering that the legacy of those years is a devastating and
sometimes fatal disease now reaching epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know that intravenous drug use, tattoos and body
piercing would be an invitation to a slow-growing virus that
eventually would become the recently identified hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Like other forms of hepatitis, the C variety inflames the liver,
causing debilitating symptoms or, even more frightening, virtually
no symptoms until the disease is on the eve of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of contracting hepatitis C continues today. Foolhardy
people still pierce, tattoo and inject themselves with unsterile
needles. Unsafe promiscuous sex can put partners in danger.
Health-care workers who suffer accidental needle sticks must be on
guard.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, these people, too, could begin to feel the
effects of the insidious illness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's patients who received blood transfusions before 1992,
before testing of the blood supply was refined, who are the target
of an intense public-education campaign spearheaded by the office
of the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's office has urged organizations such as the American
Red Cross, hospitals and blood banks to notify pre-1992 blood
recipients and recommend they be tested for hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying and contacting that population will be a daunting
but worthwhile task, doctors say. Though critics have questioned
the cost-effectiveness of alerting people to a disease that can be
treated in less than half of all cases, health-care advocates
insist patients have a right to know their health status and that
withholding information is disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is preposterous,'' says Dr. Michael Altman, a Phoenix
gastroenterologist, president of the Arizona chapter of the
American Liver Foundation. Although conceding that better
treatments are needed, he says he can offer patients hope. ``Why
would you not want to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 5 percent of patients refuse medication, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who cannot be cured must be informed on how to manage
their disease and how to avoid transmitting it. They should drink
no alcohol, be scrupulous about protecting others from infection
and maintain good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   How long hepatitis C has been around is anybody's guess. It may
have its origins in World War II, where unsterile battlefield blood
transfusions could have spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
   First called non-A, non-B hepatitis because its specific virus
couldn't be differentiated from other strains, it wasn't identified
until 1975. A blood test wasn't developed until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That blood test remained unreliable until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hepatitis A (transmitted through unsanitary food
preparation) and hepatitis B (spread through blood and sexual
contact), for which there are vaccines and effective cures, the C
strain becomes chronic in 85 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   It is the leading cause of cirrhosis, which scars the liver and
inhibits its function.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates put the number of infected Americans at 4 million.
Cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, number only 1 million.
Although deaths from the human immunodeficiency virus are
declining, fatal cases of hepatitis C are rising, expecting to
triple in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet HIV has enjoyed much more media and medical attention.
Doctors who work with hepatitis C patients are dismayed by such
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the furor raised over HIV,'' says Altman, the Phoenix
gastroenterologist. ``(Hepatitis) C has been underpublicized.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, three-fourths of all victims of hepatitis C are
unaware they carry the disease. Many show no signs of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when hepatitis C reaches its end stage, it becomes the
leading reason for liver transplants. More than 4,000 transplants
are performed each year, and 10,000 names are on the waiting list.
About 1,000 patients will die while waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Although diseased kidneys can be assisted by dialysis, no
machine can perform the functions of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hefty 4.5 pounds, the organ has a lot of reserve, says
Dr. David Leibowitz, gastroenterologist and chair of the department
of medicine at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the liver's large capacity allows it to quietly
harbor disease for many years without signaling its deterioration.
When the silence finally is broken, the patient may experience
fatigue, malaise, flulike symptoms, weakness, jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   More serious symptoms indicating advanced disease include fluid
retention in the ankles and abdomen, confusion, increased risk of
bleeding, intestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Until a routine blood test picks up elevated liver enzymes,
problems may go undetected. Only a specific blood test will
identify hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to catch hepatitis C early,'' says Dr. David
Douglas, a liver specialist at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale. ``We hope to
catch people before they develop cirrhosis. . . . It is a very
silent, progressive disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is director of the Mayo liver clinic and medical
director of the liver transplant program, which is just getting
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo is conducting several research protocols on hundreds of
hepatitis C patients. Age of the patients ranges from people in
their 20s to those in their 80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors hesitate to call treatments for hepatitis C
``cures'' _ scattered bits of virus may remain, says Leibowitz of
the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center _ medication does offer
some hope. Currently, the drug of choice is interferon, which
produces remission or suppression of the virus in about 20 percent
of cases. That means liver enzymes appear normal and the virus
cannot be detected.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon is delivered as self-administered injections three
times a week for 12 to 18 months. Some patients tolerate the drug
well. Some experience serious physical and emotional side effects,
including depression.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved use of
another drug, ribavirin, which in combination with interferon
boosts recovery rates to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's significant,'' says Douglas of Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Such combinations of drugs, called cocktails, are proving to be
sound methods of treatment for diseases such as hepatitis C and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas predicts that more drugs, including anti-viral agents,
will be developed and used to battle hepatitis C in the next three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   A research laboratory in California also is working on a
vaccine, says Good Samaritan's Leibowitz, that could be used one
day to immunize all newborns in the same way infants are currently
vaccinated against hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``universal'' vaccines are ``the way to go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the key to managing hepatitis C now, Douglas says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to raise public awareness of hepatitis C,''
he says. ``People aren't aware of liver diseases in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma with the current epidemic, says Phoenix
gastroenterologist Altman, is ``how do we go about educating people
without alarming or frightening them?''
</P>
<P>
   The American Liver Foundation is committed to supporting
research and informing the public about liver diseases. The
foundation lobbies Congress for funding and works with the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, the Arizona chapter of the Liver Foundation
sponsors monthly support groups for patients, hosts seminars for
patients and primary care physicians, and conducts programs in
schools that alert children to the dangers of drug and alcohol
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, who also participates in research studies, is optimistic
about the treatment of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rapidly evolving therapeutic arena,'' he says. ``I tell
my patients to call me every six months. We're all frustrated by
having a 20 percent cure rate (with interferon alone), but it's the
best we've got right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned.'' &QL;
