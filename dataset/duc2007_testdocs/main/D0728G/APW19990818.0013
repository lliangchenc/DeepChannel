<HEADLINE> 2.7M Americans May Have Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At least 2.7 million Americans carry the hepatitis C virus,  
making it the most common blood-borne infection in the United 
States, according to a study in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  
Atlanta represents the first look at the prevalence of hepatitis C 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we consider a conservative estimate,'' said Dr.  
Harold Margolis of the CDC. ``This is everyday Mr. and Mrs. 
American who live in a household. This doesn't include the homeless 
and the prison population. The number could be higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons that aren't entirely clear, an estimated 1.2 million  
other people who were once infected no longer have any signs of the 
virus, Margolis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists discovered the virus in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	People who inject illegal drugs or engage in unprotected sex  
account for most people who carry hepatitis C, but people who had 
blood transfusions before mid-1992 also are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease and alcohol abuse rank as the leading causes of  
liver disease. The infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer 
and results in about 1,000 liver transplants annually in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination  
of interferon and ribavirin. In some patients, drugs can make all 
signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect 
lasts.
