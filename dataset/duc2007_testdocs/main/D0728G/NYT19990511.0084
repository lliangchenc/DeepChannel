 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: What is hepatitis C?
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hepatitis C. Is this the disease that
should scare the middle-age bejesus out of Baby Boomers for their
dumb indiscretions 25 years ago? Or is it a medical panic attack
that will pass like a swine-flu scare?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kicked
off Hepatitis Awareness Month. Watch out, the CDC said: The
chronic, potentially deadly, liver disease infects 4 million of us,
and half don't even know they have it. The CDC is targeting two
audiences: People who had blood transfusions before 1992, and a
trickier group _ healthy, tax-paying, PTA-involved, soccer moms and
dads entrenched in the suburbs. Twenty or 30 years ago, they
flirted with peace and love and pass the needle while trying
cocaine, heroin or speed. And they may have gotten hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C can kill liver cells and cause scarring, called
cirrhosis. It is the leading reason for liver transplants. Last
year there were 4,100 transplants _ with twice that many people
waiting for a new liver.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as the nation's ever-cautious school nurse, the CDC has
labeled hepatitis C ``an emerging chronic disease of great public
health concern.''
</P>
<P>
   This month's Redbook magazine calls it ``the next deadly
epidemic.'' Last month's New York magazine wondered if it was ``the
new AIDS.'' TV's ER and L.A. Doctors have climbed aboard with
hepatitis C storylines.
</P>
<P>
   But how worried should Baby Boomers really be?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say hepatitis C is less an epidemic than ``an epidemic
of discovery,'' says Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the National Health
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   People infected 20 or 30 years ago are now discovering they may
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Disposable needles and blood screening for transfusions have cut
new cases of the C virus from 240,000 a year through the '80s to
less than 30,000 a year today _ but past undiscovered cases have
prompted the CDC's current push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you say `epidemic,' the concern among the public is,
`Good Lord, around the corner there's a virus lurking, and I'm
going to get it.' That's not the case,'' says Seeff, the NIH's
senior scientist for hepatitis C research.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease is, he says, ``a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Visit Dr. Eugene Schiff, one of the nation's top liver doctors,
in his office at the University of Miami Medical School, and he
lays out the facts:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you the typical case of hepatitis C right now,''
says Schiff, director of UM's Center for Liver Diseases. ``Between
40 and 50, often mainstream America, very successful people. But go
back in time, back when they were 16 or 17, and that person shared
a needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get sick at the time, they didn't even think about
it. As they got older, they went on to college, many were blood
donors, wanted to help out the community. Good people. They were
carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until 1990 _ after some of these people had been giving
blood for many, many years _ did they go into the blood bank and
get a screening test. They were told, `You've got hepatitis C.'
They didn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it turns out when you really talk to these people,
establish confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some CEO of a company isn't going to tell you he ever played
around with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In one painful way, the hepatitis C scare resembles the early
years of AIDs research _ so much hysteria, so few facts.
</P>
<P>
   What if you got a tattoo with a dirty needle? What if you got
your ears pierced 25 years ago? What if you had sex with a drug
user? Could these things cause hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all those questions: Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a mystical virus,'' Seeff explains. ``This virus
is not breathed in, you don't swallow it. It has to get in through
a skin barrier or through some open cut. It's a question of being
exposed to infectious material.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is mystical is trying to define the actual, specific
methods of transfer. It has to be blood from A into blood from B.
The question is: How does that occur?''
</P>
<P>
   No one, so far, is 100 percent sure, but the major risks remain
needles and transfusions (before 1992) with tainted blood. There is
no data to show that piercings, tattoos or sex cause risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't recommend anyone who had a tattoo be tested,'' says
Dr. Joanna Buffington, CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would be very, very, very unlikely that someone who got
their ears pierced by a gun in a mall got hepatitis from that,''
says Buffington.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC advises safe sex if one partner is infected until more
facts arrive. Only now is the CDC paying for a three-year study of
1,000 sex partners _ one infected, one not _ to see if sexual
transmission is a risk.
</P>
<P>
   And what about people who have the virus? Will they die from it?
Again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4 million Americans estimated to have been infected, it's
estimated that 30,000 will die by 2010 because of liver disease
caused by chronic hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
   That's 30,000 people out of a nation of 250 million.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with hepatitis C, the
virus simply goes away. The other 80 to 85 percent develop chronic
hepatitis C, and it takes 20 years or more for 20 percent of them
to develop cirrhosis _ and then the big problems can begin. But
less than 5 percent of people who develop cirrhosis eventually need
a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the big picture, it isn't a huge number,'' says Buffington
at the CDC. ``Many, many more people are dying of lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   People with chronic hepatitis C have two choices if and when
their livers begin to act up: treatment or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Grasso, a 40-year-old Port St. Lucie, Fla. construction
worker, chose treatment _ even though it makes him feel sicker than
his hepatitis C ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always rundown and tired, like I always had a
hangover,'' says Grasso. ``I drank enough alcohol to ruin my liver.
I was used to hangovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso, who quit drinking four years ago, had a liver biopsy.
His hepatitis C had not yet caused long-term liver damage, but his
liver was inflamed. He felt it was just a matter of time before he
got liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of whether you want to live or die,'' he says.
``I'm only 40, I have two children. I want to be around a little
longer. There is no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   His best option: A combination of two powerful drugs _
interferon and ribavirin _ taken for six months to a year. His best
odds: A 40-percent chance to rid his body of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Grasso injects interferon under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost guaranteed the day after an injection I have
flu-like symptoms, a fever. It's all you can do to get through
work. It's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, he takes six pills, ribavirin. ``I get headaches,
insomnia. I can go three days without sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset the side-effects, he takes: a pain pill twice daily, a
blood pressure pill and sleeping pill. He also takes a handful of
vitamins and herbal medicines that won't hurt him but might help.
</P>
<P>
   For the interferon and ribavirin, Grasso's HMO paid $1,831 for a
six-week supply. Depending on results, he'll need the drugs for
three months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the week, I'm pretty much out of it,'' says
Grasso. ``I don't want to get out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   For a 40 percent shot at getting rid of the virus, Grasso must
endure months of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Van Tuyl made a different choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman was infected with chronic
hepatitis C from a blood transfusion _ either after her serious car
accident in 1966 or several hip operations before 1990.
</P>
<P>
   She, like Grasso, burned up the Internet for hepatitis
information. She read about one of several new treatments being
tested, PEG-Intron A, that may work faster with fewer side-effects
than the two-drug combination that Grasso is taking. Eventually _
in 10 to 15 years _ there may be a vaccine, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I nuts? Or do I wait a year for PEG or something better to
hit the market?'' she says. ``This is a slow-moving disease, so
maybe waiting a year is the thing to do. Plus, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like the odds of success _ 10 to 40 percent _ with
interferon and ribavirin. And her neighbor, who unsuccessfully
tried interferon, has told her about the gruesome side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tuyl will wait.
</P>
<P>
   With the hepatitis C hysteria comes another similarity to the
dark days of AIDs _ shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a tremendous stigma,'' says Thelma King
Thiel, CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International, based in
Cedar Grove, N.J. ``People are losing their jobs, they're being
ostracized. With hepatitis C, there's such ignorance out there. We
have such a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's common for doctors to advise patients not to tell anyone
they're infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to peel people off the ceiling all the time because of
all the negative stuff that's out there,'' says Thiel.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the controversy late last year was a drug maker's
Web site calling hepatitis C an epidemic. The Schering-Plough Corp.
featured pictures of ghastly jaundiced people with the message:
``To put it bluntly, every living, breathing human being can get
hepatitis C _ even you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough is the maker of Intron A (interferon) and
Rebetol (ribavirin), the drugs used together _ at a cost of about
$300 a week _ to rid the body of the chronic C virus in some
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the American Liver Foundation came under fire for a
hepatitis warning billboard in Sacramento featuring a coffin with
the message: This space reserved for victims of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Overly dramatic _ and untrue, says Seeff of the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without a vaccine and without good treatment,'' he says,
``most of the people infected are going to die from the diseases
most of us will die from _ heart disease, lung disease, alcohol,
trauma, gun shots and God-knows-what. Some of them will die of
liver disease _ but the figure is hard to define.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Health has just awarded a contract for
a wide-ranging, eight-year study of the hepatitis C virus and
answers to many questions will be forthcoming as the research moves
along.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there will be various opinions on what causes
hepatitis C _ and uncertainty may fuel more hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Says Seeff: ``In medicine, different opinions mean we just don't
know.''
