<HEADLINE> New Drug Combination Fights Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- People infected with hepatitis
C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada
discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six
months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug
combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they
would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of
interferon.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C," said
Morris Sherman, an assistant professor in medicine at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to these studies the success rate for treatment was
somewhere around 15 to 20 percent. With these drugs, with the
combination, it is now approximately 40 percent."
</P>
<P>
The key drug involved -- known as ribavirin -- has not been
approved for official use in Canada, but it is available
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The traditional drug, interferon, approved in Canada in 1991,
has helped in 40 percent of the cases, but the benefits are
generally not long lasting as less than 15 percent of the patients
achieve complete remission after the treatment.
</P>
<P>
As part of an international group of researchers from the
United States, Australia, Greece and Canada, Dr. Sherman conducted
his study with 832 patients in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Six months after treatment, 43 percent of those who undergone
48 weeks of combination therapy had undetectable levels of the
virus, compared to 19 percent of those on interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Canadians are infected with hepatitis C, a
blood-borne virus spread in the same way as AIDS.
