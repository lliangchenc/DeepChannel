<P>
   Three years ago, when Patricia Buchanan, a 43-year-old woman
living in Brooklyn Park, Minn., consulted her doctor about fatigue
and a vague feeling of illness, she expected to be told that her
problems were due to smoking and excess weight.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis turned out to be much worse: She had hepatitis C,
a viral infection of the liver. She had probably been infected 15
or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all
patients, she had developed a chronic infection.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people with chronic hepatitis C carry the
virus indefinitely, apparently with few ill effects. But about 20
percent develop cirrhosis and liver failure or cancer within 20 to
25 years of being infected. The infection causes 8,000 to 10,000
deaths per year in the United States, and it has become the leading
reason for liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan's lab tests and a biopsy revealed scarring of the
liver, indicating that she might be one of the unfortunate ones in
whom the disease would worsen. Hoping to prevent further liver
damage, her doctor recommended drug treatment to try to rid her
system of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan, who has four grown children and runs her own
business, a ceramics studio, had never even heard of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two decades, many more Americans are expected to
find themselves in the same situation. Most will be middle-aged
people who feel fine now, but who will become ill, as Mrs. Buchanan
did, and find out they were infected years ago. Others will receive
letters from the government and blood banks as part of a program to
inform 300,000 people who may have been infected by transfusions
before 1992, when a test for the hepatitis C virus came into use.
For people like Mrs. Buchanan, with clear signs of liver damage,
doctors strongly recommend treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But those who test positive for the virus but have no signs of
disease will face difficult questions about whether to start
treatment, because it is expensive, complicated by severe side
effects and, in more than half of patients, unable to eradicate the
virus. Treatment is generally not recommended for those without
signs of liver damage, but regular monitoring is, because in the
early stages of infection it is impossible to tell whether the
disease will progress.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and most
of them do not know they are carrying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know they need treatment may find themselves caught in
a controversy similar to the ones that have erupted over
high-priced treatments for AIDS. Their interests have collided with
those of a pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research
expenses and turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers say that the company,
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., is needlessly alarming
Americans about the disease in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.
There is no vaccine. Before the test for the virus came into use,
transfusions were the main route of transmission. Since then, the
number of new infections has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured
on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow
eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease. ``To put it
bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can
get hepatitis C _ even you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising
campaign has ``breached the public trust.'' But in a telephone
interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word
``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4
million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research
at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said,
``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting
infected like crazy, and that's not so.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the
pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected
with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious
side effects, whether they need them or not. He said more than 80
percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no
disease whatsoever.'' But he added that people with the virus must
never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier
patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid
of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive
diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said:
``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C. New cases have
fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus. The
epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when
there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got
into the population that donated blood. People infected then are
now turning 50 and 60, at which point hepatitis C rears its head.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial
increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though
donor organs are already in short supply. Hepatitis deaths are also
expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or
30,000 a year within a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline
again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an
estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s. By
1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of
needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new
infections in the United States. Among those who have injected
drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less
clear. Although sexual contact does not seem to spread hepatitis C
efficiently (unlike the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses), 20 percent
of infected people report no other means of exposure. Another 10
percent are thought to have been infected while working at a
hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth,
or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other
way to infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   For the final 10 percent, there is simply no explanation for the
infection. Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body
piercing _ and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments
could spread the virus _ the CDC says there is no evidence linking
those practices to the disease in the United States. Similarly,
many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing
straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether
that has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group,
having never received a transfusion or taken drugs. Her husband and
other family members all tested negative for the virus, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan
enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with
Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates
the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients. But half of patients do
not respond to interferon at all, and Mrs. Buchanan was one of
those. At the time, interferon was the only treatment available.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with
the antiviral drug ribavirin. The combination, Rebetron, made by
Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about
twice as many patients as interferon did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it
had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal
thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. Nonetheless, Mrs. Buchanan
wanted to try the combination treatment. But because
Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she
hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another
form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another
company. She had researched it on her own, and thought it might
work better for her. Her doctor agreed it was worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly found out that would not be possible.
Schering-Plough had ``bundled'' the two drugs, packaging them
together as a kit. Patients could buy Schering's interferon alone,
but not ribavirin. A company spokesman said the product was
packaged that way because there was no approved use for ribavirin
except in combination with interferon as a treatment for hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   Because Schering-Plough had the exclusive right to market
ribavirin in the United States, there was no other way to buy it.
Mrs. Buchanan did not want to purchase the entire kit _ a six-month
supply costs $6,400 to $8,600 _ just to get the ribavirin.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Schering said the price of Rebetron reflected
the hundreds of millions of dollars it has cost to develop the
product.
</P>
<P>
   The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing
genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to
people with hepatitis C. Many, like Mrs. Buchanan, wanted to mix
ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly
people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of
interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away
the extra medication because it was perishable.
</P>
<P>
   The bundling also sent up a red flag among advocates for AIDS
patients. Some people taking a host of drugs to treat HIV also have
hepatitis C, and want as much flexibility as possible in picking
medications. The AIDS groups began showing hepatitis patients how
to do battle with big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Getty, who is active in AIDS issues in San Francisco, said,
``The HIV and AIDS community is watching this and very much up in
arms about it, because we know what it means for us.'' Getty said
he feared that companies would similarly bundle combination
treatments for AIDS, interfering with doctors' ability to prescribe
different combinations for patients. ``Where does it stop?'' Getty
asked. ``Do I have to buy their Kleenex taped to their nose spray,
because they were tested together? This is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One AIDS group has begun buying ribavirin from Mexico, which
imports it from a U.S. company. The group provides it to hepatitis
C patients at cost, which comes to less than half what ribavirin
would cost in the bundled product.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and advocacy groups asked the FDA to require that
Rebetron be unbundled, but Dr. Heidi Jolson, director of the
division of antiviral drugs at the agency, said its lawyers had
determined that it lacked the regulatory authority to do so. Jolson
did write to Schering-Plough, saying that the product did not have
to be bundled and that the agency would cooperate if the company
decided to sell the drugs separately.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo, said Schering-Plough has listened to the concerns of
patient advocates and is developing a program to help provide
ribavirin to hepatitis patients whose doctors can prove that the
patients have a need for it. The program will start in January, he
said, though patients who need help sooner may get it if their
doctors contact the company.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to Mrs. Buchanan, who said her letter to the
company had never been answered.
