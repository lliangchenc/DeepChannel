FDA APPROVES WIDER USE OF LIVER DRUG

<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded
use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C,
a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver
cancer and liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C infects an estimated four million Americans and
kills 8,000 to 10,000 a year. The disease, spread mainly by dirty
needles and exposure to infected blood, is the leading reason for
liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in
June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon
drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease. The
expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to
patients who had not taken interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebetron treatment combines interferon injections with a
second anti-viral drug, ribavirin, which is swallowed in capsules.
</P>
<P>
   A six-month treatment costs $6,400 to $8,600. By the end of
October, Rebetron sales had totaled $46 million, according to IMS
Health, a firm that tracks the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA cautioned that Rebetron is not a cure and that it is not
known whether the treatment can delay the progression of liver
disease caused by the virus. It suppresses blood levels of the
virus far better than interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need
Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike
symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior. It can also
cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded use was approved over the protests of patient
advocates, who object to the way Rebetron is being sold. Interferon
and ribavirin are sold together as a kit, a practice known as
bundling. Patients cannot get ribavirin without purchasing the
entire kit.
</P>
<P>
   A Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is
sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only
in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe
ribavirin with another brand of interferon. And they accuse
Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high
price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon. &QL;

<P>
   In another hepatitis treatment development, Glaxo Wellcome and
Biochem Pharma said Wednesday that the FDA had approved their drug,
lamivudine, as the first oral therapy for the treatment of
hepatitis B. In the United States, the drug will have a wholesale
cost of $1,250 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lamivudine, also known as 3TC and marketed under the trade name
Epivir, has previously been approved for the HIV virus, for which
it is the most commonly prescribed drug. Epivir for AIDS will
generate an estimated $800 million in revenue this year. Hepatitis
B affects many more people than AIDS, perhaps as many as 350
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those patients are in Asian countries, where the cost of
the drug may be prohibitive, so analysts say it is difficult to
estimate the potential market. But there are an estimated one
million hepatitis B patients in North America and about twice that
many in Europe, where price is less of an issue.
