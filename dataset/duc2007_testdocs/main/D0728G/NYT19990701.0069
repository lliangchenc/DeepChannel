 ALTERNATIVE SOURCE FOR HEPATITIS C DRUG ON WAY  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny mail-order pharmacy in Pennsylvania is preparing to do
battle against drug giant Schering-Plough Corp. for a stake in the
burgeoning market for hepatitis C treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has
announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral
drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in
combination with the drug interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is typically spread through
contact with contaminated blood and now infects an estimated 4
million Americans, although only about 1 million have been
diagnosed. Chronic carriers often go decades without symptoms but
may eventually develop severe liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   The ribavirin-interferon combination generates a lasting
response in fewer than half of those who try it, often at the cost
of serious side effects. Still, the combination is considered the
best treatment now available for most patients.
</P>
<P>
   Schering reported worldwide sales of $719 million for the two
drugs last year, reflecting both a growing demand among HCV
patients as well as some use for treating cancer and other
conditions. The company claims more than 80 percent of the HCV drug
market.
</P>
<P>
   But along with that success, the New Jersey-based drugmaker has
also generated complaints of high prices and overly aggressive
marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Schering-Plough has been the sole source
of ribavirin, sold only as part of a kit that also include's the
company's proprietary brand of interferon, called Intron A.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of interferon are available from different
manufacturers. Some patient advocates charge that Schering's
bundling strategy has made it difficult for people to experiment
with different drug combinations and dosages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anticompetitive,'' said Brian Klein, a San Francisco
leader of a national patients group called the Hepatitis C Action
and Advocacy Coalition. ``It's delaying research and hurts
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The group issued nationwide e-mail alerts this week announcing
the new source of ribavirin, complete with the Pittsburgh
pharmacy's toll-free phone number (888-347-3416) and Web site
(www.spsdrug.com).
</P>
<P>
   Schering's spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said the company is
convinced that its package is the safest, most convenient way to
make the drugs available. Special ``compassionate use''
arrangements can be worked out for patients who need ribavirin
alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The HCV drug kit was specifically approved only as a combination
product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. By contrast,
European authorities have banned such practices, forcing Schering
to seek approval to market each product individually. That
application was approved by European regulators just last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh pharmacy said it holds all the necessary licenses
to fill mail-order prescriptions as a so-called ``compounding''
pharmacy, referring to the specialized practice of preparing
individual drug orders.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Stein, one of three pharmacists at Fisher's, would not
disclose her supplier of ribavirin, other than to say it is
imported from abroad. She said the product has been tested and
found to be pure.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacy plans to fill capsules as individual prescription
orders are received starting after midnight July 8, when certain
U.S. patent rights Schering holds will expire.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-order pharmacy is offering the anti-viral drug at $1.25
per 200-mg capsule. That works out to about one-fifth the cost of
the same drug obtained in the Schering-Plough combination kit.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo said the drugmaker has no plans to change its marketing
practices or prices. He also said that patients need to be wary of
the possibility that other sources of ribavirin may not meet the
manufacturer's standards for purity and other chemical factors.
