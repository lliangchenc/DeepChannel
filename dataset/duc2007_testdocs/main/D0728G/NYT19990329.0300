   The early moments after patients are infected with the feared
Ebola virus may be the most important to their survival,
researchers report this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully
taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during
outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo. This is in itself a feat because
outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and
because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks
in Africa since its first appearance in 1979. But this exotic virus
gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills
horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody
hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days. Second, researchers worry that
Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may
one day break out.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Dr. Sylvain Baize and Eric M. Leroy of the International
Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking
difference in the first days of the infection between those who
would eventually die and those who would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and
are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
</P>
<P>
   The research focused on the differences between those who lived
and those who died. They discovered that the immune defenses in the
two groups were quite distinct.
</P>
<P>
   The immune system puts up two general types of defense against
invading microbes. In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify
and latch on to the invading bugs. In the other, the cellular
system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
</P>
<P>
   Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable
enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to
attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a
substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and
modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and
cellular defenses.
</P>
<P>
   These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their
blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and
interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did
not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within
the first two to three days after infection. They had a poor
showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too
much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive
production of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of
the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby
passing information that would suppress the other side of the
defense. Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus
that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests
that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene
in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one
or depressing the other.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip K. Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, said the work represented an important
step in understanding how Ebola works.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the
federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help
researchers test ideas. For example, therapies that would suppress
the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses
might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said. But
therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.
