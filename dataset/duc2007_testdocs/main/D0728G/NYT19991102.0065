TEXAS CHANGES PROVIDER OF HEPATITIS TREATMENT

<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a move that could save millions of dollars,
health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing
a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy
rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the
drug has been controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance
organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from
Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr. Jason
Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy
approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of hepatitis C. Prison system health-care officials
decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination
therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's
inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the
potentially lethal liver virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for
treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern
that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on
the prison health-care budget.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of
hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough
Corp., a drug manufacturer based in Madison, N.J. The other drug in
the kit is Schering-Plough's brand of alpha interferon. For a
standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two
drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the
prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
</P>
<P>
   By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from
another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the
combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for
the same cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough
for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product
called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another
brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough responded that the drug had been tested for this
purpose only with its brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin _
obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into
capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's
prescription. The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply,
compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of
the Schering-Plough kit.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving
combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible
to provide the treatment to many more.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the
compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been
subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is
safe and effective in combination with interferon.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on its
response to Schering-Plough's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas
Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison
system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established
that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to
Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
</P>
<P>
   Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began
looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin
after realizing that many patients, including some with health
insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.
</P>
<P>
   After the patent for Ribavirin expired recently, he said, the
pharmacy's lawyers did some research and concluded that compounding
the drug would be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrish also said he was contacted recently by an attorney in
the Texas attorney general's office, who told him that the office
was ``looking at investigating Schering-Plough'' for possible
violations of anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrish said the attorney asked him questions about the drugs
used to treat hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 17 article, The Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger quoted an
unnamed spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office as
saying that an investigation of Schering-Plough was in the
``initial stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Delisi, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
that the office's policy is never to confirm or deny
investigations.
