<HEADLINE> China Starts Mass -Producing Genetic Engineering Drug </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has started to put into mass
production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat
liver diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing
University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b
interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public
Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic
engineering drug to be put into mass production in the
biotechnology section of the country's "863 Hi-Tech Plan".
</P>
<P>
China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for
scientific and technological development in 1978. Biotechnology
was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986,
when the "863" plan was introduced. So far, China has put onto the
market five genetic engineering drugs, and another dozen such
drugs are under research.
</P>
<P>
Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells and
internationally acknowledged as efficacious for the treatment of
liver diseases, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was
established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in
the "863" plan. He discovered for the first time that the white
blood cells of Chinese people, when attacked by viruses, will
produce "a 1" type instead of "a 2" type interferons. He
subsequently succeeded in developing recombinant a-1b interferon
-- the first interferon expressed by a gene isolated from healthy
Chinese leukocyte cells.
</P>
<P>
To put the interferon into mass production, the Shenzhen Kexing
Bioproducts Co. Ltd, China's largest genetic engineering medicine
production base, was set up in 1993 under the State Science and
Technology Commission.
