 Studies could advance hepatitis C treatment
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been no truly effective treatment for
hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that is spread in the same ways as
AIDS, and that is believed to infect about 4 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A drug called interferon helps in 40 percent of cases, but the
benefits are short-lived. Only 10 to 15 percent of patients remain
in remission, six months after treatment is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But two studies published in the current New England Journal of
Medicine offer new hope. One, led by researchers at the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six
months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug
called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients
being treated for the first time. That's 3 to 5 times the response
rate for people getting interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   The other study, led by researchers at the University of Florida
College of Medicine in Gainesville, found that six months after
treatment, the same combination was 49 percent effective in
patients who had relapsed after previous treatment. This is 10
times higher than treatment with interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the studies represent an ``important advance,'' says
Dr. T. Jake Liang, chief of the liver diseases section at the
National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases,
part of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear how long treatment should last. In the
California study, there was little difference in outcome whether
people were treated for six months or 12. But the studies are ``a
big step forward,'' Liang said in a telephone interview.

 &UR; Study shows Prozac fights panic disorder
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It's official: Prozac, like the antidepressants Zoloft and
Paxil, has now been shown to work against panic disorder, a
debilitating illness that affects 3 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a study led by Dr. David Michelson of Eli Lilly, the maker of
Prozac, the popular antidepressant proved safe and effective in
reducing panic attacks and symptoms of phobia, anxiety, and
depression in people with panic disorder, a syndrome in which a
person suffers repeated attacks of panic. The study is in this
month's American Journal of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study published in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association, Brown University researchers showed
that Zoloft, already used for acute depression, is also effective
as an ongoing treatment for chronic depression.

 &UR; Major lung surgery is small operation
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minimally invasive surgery _ in which doctors operate through
one or more small incisions, often aided by tiny TV cameras in
fiber optic cables _ is clearly an idea whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really possible to remove an entire, intact lung this
way and send the patient home the same day?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, says Dr. Eduardo R. Tovar, a thoracic surgeon at St. Jude
Medical Center in Fullerton, Calif., who describes his technique in
this month's issue of Chest, a journal of the American College of
Chest Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, surgeons have used one long incision _ from the
shoulder blade, under the arm, around to the front _ to remove a
cancerous lung. In the last five years, they've also used minimally
invasive surgery, which involves four or five small incisions
between the ribs for viewing plus a 4-inch incision under the arm
through which the lung is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tovaro says he can remove a lung using only one small _
3-inch _ incision on the patient's side.
</P>
<P>
   In the five patients reported on _ he has also done four others
_ Tovar occasionally uses a miniature TV camera inserted through
the same incision to see ligaments that he needs to cut. He
anesthetizes nerves in the area by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   One patient went home the same day. Four others went home the
next morning. With standard minimally invasive surgery, patients
stay in the hospital five to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an eye-opening article,'' says Dr. Joseph LoCicero,
chief of general thoracic surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston, though it's unclear how many patients can
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It ``boggled my mind,'' adds Dr. A. Jay Block, editor in chief
of the journal. But, he said, ``I doubt there are a whole lot of
surgeons who could do this at the moment.''
