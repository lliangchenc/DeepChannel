<P>
   Down into the lifeless, oxygen-free depths of the Black Sea, and
on the edge of the American continental shelf where the Hudson
River plunges into the deep ocean, explorers will deploy an array
of high-tech gear this week in search of history that has lain out
of reach for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from
an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps
shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes,
possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   Off the coast of New York, an expedition led by oceanographer
Robert Ballard and archeologist Kevin McBride of the University of
Connecticut will search for signs of human settlements that may
predate any ever found on land on the East Coast, perhaps revealing
how and when this part of the continent was first settled _ maybe
as far back as the height of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coming close on the heels of stunning discoveries last year, the
searches represent the dawning of another era in archeology, a
dramatic advance made possible by oceanographic research tools,
including precisely-controllable robotic vehicles with electronic
cameras, and high-resolution sonar detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in
deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an
astonishing trove of data. In just three weeks, a Mediterranean
expedition, led by Boston University archeologist Anna Marguerite
McCann and Ballard, discovered five Roman shipwrecks spanning
virtually the entire history of Roman maritime trade. These ships
lay as much as 2,800 feet deep on the ocean floor. Before then, no
ancient wreck had been found deeper than 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were
better preserved than any found in shallow water. At those depths,
McCann said, there is little of the activity that quickly destroys
shallower shipwrecks, including wind and wave action, devouring by
marine creatures, or looting by treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deep sea's opened up'' for archeology, said McCann in an
interview last week. And it was last year's remarkably successful
Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the
technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often
tradition-bound field of archeology, she said. ``It was a
breakthrough, a true beginning for marine archeology.''
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues in the field were profoundly critical, McCann
said, when Ballard first offered back in 1989 to apply his team's
equipment and expertise to the untested idea of deep-water
archeology. They were skeptical because Ballard was not an
archeologist, because of his high public profile since his
discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, and because they thought
robotic deep-sea vehicles would be too clumsy to recover artifacts
without breaking them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballard is not an archeologist,'' McCann conceded, ``but I'm
not an engineer or an oceanographer. The technology is here, and
there are treasure hunters using this and selling stuff. I thought,
`We've got to get into this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In weighing whether to go against her colleagues' advice and
join the expedition, said McCann, now 65, who already was
considered one of the nation's leading authorities on Roman-era
archeology, ``I thought, `Why not? I'm old, I don't have to worry
about tenure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University,
which already has one of the nation's leading departments for
dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater
archeology. What is needed now, according to both oceanographers
and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering
deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who
will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and
in the technology of deep marine exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard sees himself as a kind of matchmaker in helping to bring
about the marriage of these two fields. &UR;  &LR; ``There's a new
opportunity here,'' he said last week, ``to bring together the
world of oceanography with the world of archeology, and to try to
create a new field of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the
continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been
explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many
years. But deeper water, where only expensive submersibles,
submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had
never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign
on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank,
in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   That year, with thousands of schoolchildren watching through a
satellite link as part of Ballard's educational Jason Project, the
team discovered a Roman shipwreck they dubbed the Isis.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight years before they were able to take the second step
_ last year's return expedition to the area. This time, they had
some new tools: the Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine to perform the
initial reconaissance and locate promising sites, and a
sophisticated array of sonar equipment and digital cameras added to
the Jason, the world's most precisely-controllable ROV. The
three-week trip yielded eight discoveries, five of them Roman ships
ranging in age from the first century BC to about 400 AD. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What we did in the Mediterranean that had never been done
before &UR;  &LR; was to make quantitatively accurate maps of the site, to
allow all the information from that wreck site to be preserved,''
said Dana Yoerger, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution whose job includes guiding the ROVs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic
vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers
to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has
the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch
as it takes its pictures. The shapes and dimensions of objects in
its photomosaics can be measured with the precision that
archeologists achieve when they measure the position of every
artifact and plot it on maps of land sites. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Thanks to the precision of this data, McCann said, ``I think
the archeological community has been won over.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to find ancient artifacts in such deep sites not only
opens up previously unreachable areas for research, it also allows
the mapping of trade routes that were previously unknown. It also
means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better
state of preservation than those found in shallower water.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, who last year left Woods Hole to head a new
organization called the Institute for Exploration, based in Mystic,
Conn., said it was the discovery of the Titanic that opened his
eyes to that potential. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What really amazed me about the Titanic was the preservation
environment of the deep sea,'' he said. ``Ships that found their
way to the bottom in deep water were very different'' from those
near shore.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, near-shore wrecks are often rapidly buried under
accumulating sediments; in the deep sea, sediments build up at an
imperceptible rate of about a half-inch every thousand years, he
said. In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly
torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle
gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact.
</P>
<P>
   He offers a vivid vivid illustration of that benign environment.
When the team returned to the Skerki Bank site, the imprint in the
mud of an amphora they had removed eight years earlier was still
clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation may be even better in the Black Sea, Ballard
said &UR; . &LR;  ``It is the largest body of water in the world with no
oxygen,'' he said, and without oxygen the marine organisms that
often devour all the exposed wood in a wrecked ship are unable to
survive there.
</P>
<P>
   David Mindell, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who will lead the Black Sea expedition, said the
explorers hope to find evidence of a trade route directly across
the sea through deep water. ``It would have been the maritime
equivalent of the Silk Road,'' he said. ``It would have been a
pretty significant shortcut, if you could make it work, between the
Mediterranean and Central Asia.'' Some ancient texts, he said,
suggest such a route was indeed used.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographers have found that until about 7,000 years ago, the
Black Sea was a freshwater lake about 300 feet shallower than its
present level, and that it was flooded when the Mediterranean broke
through the Bosporus. That flooding, which may have buried ports in
areas that are now far offshore, is believed to have taken place
very rapidly, and some archeologists think it may have been the
origin of the Biblical story of the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the site Ballard's group will explore this week off
Long Island was also high and dry for many millennia, and may hold
sites that were once hunting encampments on land. Until about
12,000 years ago, when most of what is now New England was buried
under a mile-thick sheet of ice, the continental shelf was exposed
and may have been occupied by the ancestors of native Americans.
Connecticut's Mashantuck and Pequot tribes are helping to finance
this week's reconnaissance mission, which will once again use the
Navy's NR-1 submarine, in hopes of learning about their distant
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has gone out in this region
thinking paleo-Indians,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world
is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied
in new places, McCann said. ``The technology is here,'' she said.
``This is new knowledge, a new opportunity, and we've got to get in
there make use of it.''
