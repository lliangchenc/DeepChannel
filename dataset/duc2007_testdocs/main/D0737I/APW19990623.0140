	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Phoenician mariners sailed more than  
2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean, 
praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet 
death in a fierce tempest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two  
ships -- the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the 
same techniques he used to find the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessels' cargo -- large ceramic containers of wine -- was  
probably headed to the Pharaoh's table in Egypt or to the 
Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia, Ballard told 
a news conference Wednesday, in announcing the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician  
port of Tyre -- now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B.C. Both vessels 
were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled 
with wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, the amphorae were found intact, stacked snugly in  
rows, unlike the shards typically unearthed on land. Archaeologist 
Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on 
Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one 
of our greatest moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ships were also almost perfectly preserved -- a result of the  
bitter cold deep-sea waters, where sunlight cannot reach, the 
pressure is intense and sediment scarcely accumulates. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of  
suspending history in time. ``Human history lost in the high seas 
is waiting to be discovered,'' said Ballard, who was propelled to 
fame by his 1985 discovery of the ocean liner Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the  
Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an 
underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global 
positioning satellite. He was led to the area after a team looking 
for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago, 
photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient 
shipwreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor  
at a depth of about 1,500 feet. The fact that they sank straight to 
the bottom and were located within two miles of each other 
indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not  
previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to 
find more ancient wrecks along the same path. 
</P>
<P>
	One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45  
feet. The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on 
consignment, Stager said. Stone anchors were found, as well as 
crockery, a wine decanter and incense stands for offering prayers 
to the weather gods. 
</P>
<P>
	Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every  
voyage, but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the 
incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the pots and crockery found aboard, Stager said he  
believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and 
that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician  
ships ever found, and will aid historians and archaeologists, who 
until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea 
about Phoenician shipping. Phoenicians were a seafaring people who 
lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years, beginning in 
2300 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Stager said the findings were preliminary, noting that the  
expedition ship had just docked Tuesday night. More would be 
revealed in the coming months when the artifacts are brought to 
Harvard for study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard's expedition was sponsored by the National Geographic  
Society, the U.S. Office of Naval Research and an Israeli 
archaeological institute. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological  
ruins in deep water, partly thanks to newly developed technology. 
Past deep-water expeditions had discovered only modern ruins, such 
as the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other ship wrecks found in recent years are older than the  
Phoenician find, dating to around 1300 B.C. and 1200 B.C. But they 
were found in shallower waters and were not in as good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the answer to many of history's mysteries could be  
found under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of history books will be rewritten from what we are  
finding in the deep seas,'' Ballard said.
