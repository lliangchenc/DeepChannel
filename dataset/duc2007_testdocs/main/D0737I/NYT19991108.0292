<P>
   El Nino and La Nina, the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual
oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific
Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world, have in
recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Now some scientists believe they may have identified a
comparable kind of oscillation involving deep ocean currents. They
say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the
globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   The deep ocean currents, in effect, create a global conveyor
belt that transports great amounts of heat around the world. When
the currents run strongly, for example, Western Europe and the
North Atlantic region are relatively warm; when they are weak, they
cool off.
</P>
<P>
   One instance of this cooling, some experts now suspect, was what
is called the little ice age, an intermittent cold spell from the
14th to 19th centuries that at its coldest sent glaciers coursing
down mountain slopes and condemned much of Europe to famine by
freezing harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University discovered that cold spells
lasting several centuries, much like the little ice age, have
occurred regularly, about every 1,400 to 1,500 years, since the end
of the last full ice age some 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much bigger temperature swings, they found, occurred at the same
intervals during the ice age itself. They discovered this by
analyzing climate signals contained in ocean sediments in the North
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by putting together different sorts of evidence, other
researchers led by Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a marine geochemist at
Lamont-Doherty, have postulated that the oscillations in deep-ocean
currents may be responsible for the 1,500-year cold cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Broecker and Stewart Sutherland of Lamont-Doherty
and Tsung-Hung Peng of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration appears in the current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a long way to go before Broecker's postulate can
be proved or disproved, it appeared to provide a possible new
explanation for what Dr. Richard Alley, a climate expert at
Pennsylvania State University, called ``a fundamental beat to the
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Broecker had ``put together a very possible story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need good hypotheses,'' Alley said, ``and he's given us
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Discerning and explaining the climate's fundamental beat is
important to a central climate question of the day: whether the
atmosphere is warming because of natural changes or human-induced
changes in the atmosphere, chiefly emissions of heat-trapping waste
industrial gases, like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Broecker is a primary advocate of the concept of the ocean
conveyor belt as a climate regulator. The conveyor is believed to
be driven by changes in the salt content of the ocean's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic,
it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean
depths. Other water rushes in to replace it at the surface. This
combination is what sets the conveyor moving. The bigger and
stronger the main conveyor current, the more heat it can transport.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where
the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this
production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and
physical studies by several scientists, Broecker has concluded that
the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water
all the time, as had been thought. Rather, he says, the southern
and northern sites alternate as strong producers: when one is
giving a strong boost to the conveyor, the other is giving a weak
one, with widespread consequences for climate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies of past climates have shown that when the
North Atlantic region has been cold, as in the end of the last ice
age, Antarctica has been relatively warm. And a recent study by Dr.
Gary Clow, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in
Denver, based on an analysis of ancient Antarctic ice, suggests
that since the end of the last glaciation, Antarctica was warmer
whenever Europe was colder, as in the little ice age.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, chemical evidence shows that the production of deep
water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a
century or so ago, when the little ice age was ending, while
production has remained strong in the North Atlantic. That means
the conveyor belt in that region continues to draw heat from the
south to warm the North Atlantic region, especially Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   No firm cause-and-effect link has been established between the
conveyor's supposed oscillations and the 1,500-year recurrences of
cold spells like the little ice age. But Broecker says there is a
clear relationship between the conveyor's behavior and climate
oscillations in the last ice age. And he says that if the conveyor
has indeed oscillated since then, as now seems the case, it
suggests that the link may have persisted.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he says, ``consistent with the idea that changes in the
large-scale circulation in the ocean can have very important
effects on the atmosphere,'' and that ``we're playing with a system
that we still don't understand.''
