CHANGSHA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully
collected natural benthal electric data using an electromagnetic
survey machine at 200 meters under the sea, according to official
sources.

The machine that can work at a maximum depth of 500 meters was
developed by a research team led by He Jishan, an expert with the
Chinese Academy of Engineering. The test was taken at the electric
field under the sea of the Taiwan Straits.
