LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Animals living on the ocean
floor may be just as susceptible to climate change as
surface-dwellers, the science journal, Nature, reports.
</P>
<P>
Researchers came to this conclusion after studying the fossil
record of ostracods, minute clam-like crustaceans in deep-sea
sediment at the bottom of the North Atlantic, dating from the Late
Pliocene era more than 2.4 million years ago.

<P>
Most scientists believed the ocean floor was buffered against
climate change by the water above it, but the journal's report
today questions this deep sea environmental stability.
</P>
<P>
The diversity of deep sea animals seems to wax and wane over a
41,000-year cycle, says Dr Thomas Cronin, of the Geological
Survey, Virginia, and Dr Maureen Raymo, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
That cycle corresponds to the rhythmic vibration in the tilt of
the Earth's axis of rotation, which affects seasonality.
