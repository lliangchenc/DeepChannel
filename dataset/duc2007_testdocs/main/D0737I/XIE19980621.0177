<HEADLINE> China Planning Extensive "Seabed Forests" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has a coastline of more than 18,000 kilometers and more
than 14,000 kilometers of island coasts, but marine development,
offshore petroleum exploration, and rapid industrial development
along the coasts have caused serious environmental pollution and
damage to the marine ecology.
</P>
<P>
The amount of losses from various marine disasters including
the red tide has reached some 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion
US dollars), as against 1 billion yuan each year in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
So, seabed forests are an effective way to help sustainable
development, Zeng said, and the country's oceanography authorities
has a positive attitude toward this giant scheme.
</P>
<P>
Song Xiuwu, an oceanographer who presided over the seaweed
planting project in Changdao, joined Zeng in suggesting that
algae, shellfish, and rare marine products be developed in the
offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
The two also emphasized the study of proliferation and
protection of various algae on the seabed and different
"afforestation" projects, and Zeng even hoped to establish a
"seaweed growing festival" to get more attention.
