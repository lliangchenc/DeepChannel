BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China has recorded new
advances in the exploration of seabed polymetallic nodules in the
eastern Pacific and planning for commercial mining in the next
century, according to the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research
and Development Association (COMRRDA).
</P>
<P>
China has explored the international seabed since the late
1970s. COMRRDA registration with the United Nations as a pioneer
investor in international seabed resources in 1991 raised the
country's exploration program to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
COMRRDA had carried out nine exploratory expeditions by the
end of last year. Related operations yielded extensive data and
information on the 150,000-sq.km. area in the Pacific. The UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea requires China to relinquish 50
percent of the aforementioned area by March 5 this year. However,
China will retain the right to explore for polymetallic nodule
resources in the remaining 75,000-sq.km. area.
</P>
<P>
"China has developed a complete set of deep-sea mining
techniques and will continue to develop new techniques,"
according to a COMRRDA spokesman.
