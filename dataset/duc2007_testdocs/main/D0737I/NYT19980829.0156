   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Dutch scientists say they have
discovered toxic industrial chemicals in the tissue of whales that
normally feed in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While the quantities detected may not be harmful to the huge
mammals, the scientists say their findings, presented at a
conference in Stockholm last week, should serve as a warning of how
far the chemicals have penetrated the ocean's food chain. Some
findings also were reported in Nature magazine in July.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are so-called polybrominated compounds that are used as
flame retardants in many everyday products, like television-set
casings and children's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   While these chemicals can be useful to consumers, they appear to
be resilient and harmful in nature. Scientists say they behave much
like PCBs and DDT, which were banned for their toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated
compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably
because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators. The
molecules do not dissolve easily in water and eventually find their
way into animal and perhaps human tissue, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study showed that we are seeing warning signals that more
serious problems may be ahead,'' said Jacob de Boer, of the
Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research, who led the team that
analyzed the whale tissue. ``These compounds are useful and
relatively cheap, and industry has not been motivated to look for
alternatives. But maybe that time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   For their most recent study, de Boer and a team of 10 Dutch
scientists examined 13 sea mammals, including sperm and minke
whales that were stranded on the Dutch coast in 1996 and 1997. They
said they found traces of the compounds in the animals' fat and
sometimes in the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Significant levels of the compounds had already been found in
sea creatures that live near the coast, like dolphins and seals,
but finding them in minke and sperm whales is more disturbing, de
Boer said, because these whales normally feed at a depth of about
1,000 to 3,600 feet and the males hunt as far north as Iceland,
where the ocean is presumed to be clean. &QL;
