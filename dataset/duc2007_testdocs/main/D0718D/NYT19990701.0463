   LOS ANGELES _ Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on
Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the
atmosphere. But he is skeptical about the coffee chain's new
ambition to sell things beyond drinks and light food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what selling coffee has to do with selling
Calphalon,'' he said referring to the cookware products.
``Ultimately, I guess, I think that most people that come here,
come here to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of its customers, Starbucks investors are skeptical as
well about the company's plans, announced late Wednesday, to become
an Internet retailer, not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs,
but of everything from frying pans to towels, picture frames and
even sofas and credenzas.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. lost 28 percent of
their value Thursday, falling $10.625 to close at $26.9375, after
the company announced its Internet strategy and said that its
earnings for the fiscal year would be 10 percent below Wall
Street's expectation. More than 73 million shares changed hands,
making Starbucks the most actively traded issue.
</P>
<P>
   To many investors, the earnings disappointment and the Internet
announcement both suggested that a phenomenally successful company
was losing its focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to stretch who they are as a company into an
area where they really don't have any expertise,'' said John
Ivankoe, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz,
who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need
more fancy coffee shops, promised to do the same with Internet
strategy, with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz told analysts and investors in a conference call late
Wednesday that the company would create the ``premier lifestyle
portal on the Internet,'' saying that the Starbucks Web site would
offer ``a feeling of romance, of relaxation'' similar to what he
said a customer might experience in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Starbucks was losing its focus, telling the
analysts that the coffee-shop business ``is and always will be the
driver of what we do.'' Starbucks said it expected to earn 54 cents
a share in the year that ends on Oct. 3, rather than the 60 cents
analysts had been expecting. Last year, the company earned 44 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee
shops is falling. Rather, they just did not grow enough to make up
for other setbacks, like flat sales of the company's Frappuccino
bottled coffee drink, which is sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insist that the core business of North
American coffee shops is not overdeveloped. Sales at stores open at
least a year are up 5 percent so far this fiscal year. Starbucks,
which has about 2,000 North American shops, is opening 400 new
shops this year. It also wants to expand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has been diversifying to prepare for the day
when growth of that core business will slow.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Internet comes in. Schultz said that Starbucks
would set up a portal site by the end of this year. Once viewers
come to the home page of the site, they will be led to other pages
selling not only Starbucks coffee but gourmet food, kitchenware,
home furnishings and furniture. Many of these sites would be
managed by retailers that already sell such goods and would retain
their brand names.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company would announce a major strategic
partnership this summer to pursue the Web business. Starbucks will
also consider acquisitions and investments in other companies that
provide some of the products to be sold on the Web site. He said he
could not confirm or deny rumors that Starbucks was trying to buy
Williams-Sonoma, the retailer of fancy cookware.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the key to Starbucks' success would be its ability
to attract Web customers through its shops by such measures as
advertising the Web site on the 14 million paper cups it uses each
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have a relationship with Starbucks that is
different from a traditional bricks-and-mortar store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the customers at the Melrose Avenue shop were not
that sure. Rosie Taravella, a 37-year-old actress and screenwriter
sipping a Grande Guatamalan, remarked, ``What I'd like to see
Starbucks invest in is drive-throughs _ making the obtaining of
coffee easier.''
