	SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. shares tumbled today after the  
coffee retailer warned that shortfalls in its non-core businesses 
and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in 
lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60  
cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late Wednesday 
predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the 
next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Starbucks  
shares skidded $11.68 3/4 to $25.87 1/2 -- a decline of 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in  
Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but 
that didn't happen, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever  
for the potential for significant profit growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will play a role in that growth.  
</P>
<P>
	To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will  
form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice 
president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web  
site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and 
home furnishings as well as coffee products and music. He also said 
the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the 
Internet site later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said  
the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at 
$100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's  
customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more 
than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
