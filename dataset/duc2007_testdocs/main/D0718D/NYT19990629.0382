   STARBUCKS _ What could be more absurd than the world's biggest
coffee shop, Starbucks Corp., trying to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., a
seller of leather armchairs and mixing bowls? The two retailers

example of how the digital world is redefining businesses that are
as analog as a double decaf macchiato. By Carol Emert

effectively leaves it up to companies to inform the FDA if the
companies think the food presents any danger. By Tom Abate
