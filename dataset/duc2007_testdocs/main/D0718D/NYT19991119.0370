 &UR; CHRISTMAS _ &LR;  Strong economic conditions are expected to generate
robust retail sales this holiday season, particularly in the
prosperous Bay Area, economists and industry observers said. ``Lots
of times Christmas sales are based on psychology, and people are
feeling very bullish right now,'' said Wilkes Bashford, a Union
Square men's clothier. Bashford expects Christmas sales at his
store to be up in double digits this holiday, with much of the
growth coming from cashmere. ``The national economy is obviously
strong and I think the California economy is particularly strong,''
he said. By Carol Emert

 &UR; ZDTV _ &LR;  ZDTV, the all-computers-all-the-time cable channel, was
sold by publisher Ziff-Davis to billionaire Paul Allen yesterday
for nearly $205 million. The sale comes amid a jettisoning of
assets by Ziff after a mandate from its Japanese parent company,
Softbank, to focus almost exclusively on Internet-related
properties. ``Now we know the end of the movie,'' ZDTV's chief
executive, Larry Wangberg, told a gathering of about 250 staff
members at the channel's San Francisco headquarters yesterday
morning. By David Lazarus

part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer
