   BLAST-AFTERMATH (BELLINGHAM, Wash.) _ After more than an hour of
confusing sensor reports and shutting, opening, then shutting a
second time its 400-mile fuel pipeline, officials with Olympic Pipe
Line Co. managed to reach an employee on the way home Thursday
afternoon. He was ordered via cell phone to Whatcom Creek to check
on a possible pipeline leak. It was too late. He called back to
report a wall of fire heading his way. A reconstruction of
Thursday's explosion and what investigators have found so far.

   BLAST-VICTIMS (BELLINGHAM, Wash.) _ A remarkably sad scene
unfolded Friday morning at the elementary school Wade King and
Stephen Tsiorvas attended. Both 10-year-olds died early Friday
morning in the explosion and fire that ripped through Bellingham
Thursday. Their friends, parents and teachers recall the two boys,
remembered as mischevious and charming youngsters. The third victim
is Liam Wood, an 18-year-old who just graduated from high school.

   BLAST-ENVIRONMENT (BELLINGHAM, Wash.) _ Floating salmon fry,
leafless trees, charred field mice and not a bird song in the air
around Whatcom Creek. For a stretch a mile and half long and 100
feet wide, the watershed looks like it's been coated with black
paint. It'll take a year for the area to recover from Thursday's
gas pipeline rupture and explosion.

   TIDE (OLYMPIA, Wash.) _ Down in south Puget Sound near Olympia,
this coming week's escalating war between the ocean and the
shorelines is known to researchers as ``the bathtub slosh effect.''
The lowest tide of the year occurs Monday when the salt water drops
to minus 3.5 feet, followed by a plus 12.5 foot annual high tide.
It's awfully impressive and local maritime folks are excited about
it. It's a nightmare, however, for intertidal sealife.
