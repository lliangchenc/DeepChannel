   Almost seven years ago, Magic Johnson faced a battery of cameras
and announced his retirement from the NBA ``because of the HIV
virus I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he is remarkably robust by any definition of good health,
thanks to drugs that have been so successful that they have reduced
the virus to levels that cannot be detected. His wife and three
children are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's new TV show, ``The Magic Hour,'' is just one aspect of
a busy life:
</P>
<P>
   -- HIS HEALTH: While by no means cured, he owes the appearance
of remarkable health to a Spartan lifestyle and modern medicine.
Like many AIDS patients on these new medications, he takes a
combination of three drugs, one a protease inhibitor.Side effects
can include nausea, vomiting, headaches, backaches or
gastrointestinal problems. The drugs are expensive, costing $12,000
to $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- HIS MOVIE THEATERS: He's a partner in a joint venture with
Sony Theaters in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, with expansion
plans for nine more cities. In Atlanta, where he already has one
multiplex theater at Greenbriar Mall, the financing plans for a
second one, in south DeKalb County, drew criticism because of
concerns that public money would be used. But the plan, which was
approved by the DeKalb County Commission and will be implemented
through the DeKalb County Development Authority, provides financing
and interest rate incentives and uses funds from private investors.
</P>
<P>
   -- OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks'
first joint-venture partner, with a location in Los Angeles. He has
a joint venture with TGI Friday's, with plans to open restaurants
near his theaters. He also has formed California Urban Investment
Partners with the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
investing in commercial real estate. And he represents American
Express and Adolph Coors in TV ads. Recently, he joined Janet
Jackson and record industry executive Jheryl Busby in buying a
majority stake in Founders National Bank, California's only African
American-owned bank.
