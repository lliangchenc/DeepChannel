 Pasqua Holders Feel Stiffed by Bankers Trust  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A small group of Pasqua Inc. shareholders is accusing Bankers
Trust, Pasqua's former controlling shareholder, of stiffing
minority investors when the San Francisco coffee chain was sold to
Starbucks earlier this year.
<P>
   A complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court accused
Bankers Trust of undervaluing Pasqua ``in order to avoid
jeopardizing a long-standing business relationship (with)
Starbucks.'' A Bankers Trust lawyer denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks paid $7.1 million for the 56-cafe chain in a deal that
became final March 1, according to the complaint. In the suit, led
by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that
the company's market value was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's
stock. They are accusing Bankers Trust, which owned 45 percent and,
they say, effectively controlled the board, of breaching its
fiduciary duty by not considering bids from Starbucks' rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasqua shareholders also contend that Bankers Trust failed
to disclose a conflict of interest: that an affiliate, BT Alex.
Brown, Starbucks' longtime investment bank, was advising Starbucks
on the Pasqua merger and receiving fees for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are ``silly,'' said Peter Ostroff, a partner
with Sidley &AMP; Austin who represents Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor
group earlier this year to stop the merger. But the court allowed
the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they
received fair-market value for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the right to any relief other than an
appraisal,'' Ostroff said. ``If it turns out that the appraiser
agrees the price isn't fair, they'll get an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which originally was filed in June, was amended
in a filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Tabacco, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said in a telephone
interview yesterday that Pasqua's board did not seriously consider
offers from other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Peet's Coffee &AMP; Tea of Emeryville offered $15
million for Pasqua in February, a month before the Starbucks deal
closed. Pasqua's board should have ``engaged in an auction to
obtain the best price, that's certainly an opportunity they had,''
said Tabacco, a partner with Berman, DeValerio, Pease &AMP; Tabacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Ostroff said the Peet's offer was ``too little, too late and
much too contingent'' on unknowns to scuttle the Starbucks deal.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee-industry source who conducted an independent valuation
of Pasqua two years ago said Starbucks' $7 million price tag ``is
not out of line'' with his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pasqua had 1998 sales of $26.5 million and its Bay Area
stores were mostly healthy, its operations in New York and Los
Angeles were ``hemorrhaging money,'' this source said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, who served as Pasqua's chairman and chief executive
for many years, said he was the lone Pasqua board member to oppose
the Starbucks deal. Because shareholders never gathered for the
vote (which was conducted by mail), it was difficult to fight the
Starbucks acquisition before the deal closed, he said in a
telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman could not explain why investors holding the remaining
35 percent of Pasqua shares, including co-founder Martin Kupferman,
did not join in the suit. Kupferman could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tabacco said 90 percent of such cases end in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Peet's did not return a telephone call. A spokesman for
Starbucks, which was named in the suit as the successor to Pasqua,
declined to comment.
