`SEINFELD' CREATOR TRIES FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(Undated) - Imagine Seinfeld if it had been on HBO in stead of NBC
and it starred co-creator Larry David instead of Jerry and it had
only been as funny as it was the last couple of seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm. The
one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some
long stretches of humor-free aridness.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of
David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in
a conference call. ``It was as insincere as you could get. Insin
cere hugging is al lowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly
brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza,
he is also a former stand-up comedian himself. He hadn't performed
onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking
about giv ing it another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said. ``Like
everything else, I was reluctant at first. The more people I asked
about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea. I thought it
was a way to motivate me to get on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he wasn't interested in the standard
film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than
the straight stand-up show. Then, I started to think I needed some
other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage. We
couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had
to come up with some stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with
the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio
close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well.) Curb Your
Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally
unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing
just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the stand-up is real. I would say that there are
elements in there that are real. Most of it's embellished, but some
of it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry
David we see on-screen. ``I'm not re ally stretching there. That's
pretty much who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life
and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled,
balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really resent that `who's call ing?' '' he says while making
a phone call. ``Like some people are good enough to make the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap
pearance, commenting on David. So does Jerry himself, who relates
that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the
audience as ``you people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David. ``He just couldn't
get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate
rela tionship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when
it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing
on two feet and everybody's brilliant. . . . It's very extreme
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the
clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage. Of
course, David's life has changed as well. Seinfeld has made him a
wealthy man, in deed. But that's the only change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my
house now,'' he said. ``That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in
which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement
envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it
so funny. He famously returned for the series-ending show, which
managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of
TV's biggest flops.
</P>
<P>
   David naturally begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final
episode. ``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like
it? I loved that. It accomplished everything I think a finale
should accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because
it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale. Then again, how could it
not be? &QL;
