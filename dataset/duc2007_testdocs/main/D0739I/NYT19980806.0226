   ``Just one Clinton joke,'' a man in the audience called out when
Jerry Seinfeld appeared for his encore after the second show on
Wednesday, opening night of his brief run of stand-up performances
on Broadway. It says everything about his humor that the only
topical joke came by request, and even then it wasn't a genuine
Clinton joke. He veered smoothly away from politics into typical
Seinfeld territory, wryly observing the manners and absurdities of
contemporary life. ``Everyone lies about sex,'' he said. ``People
lie  &UR; during &LR;  sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd  &UR; be &LR;  no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Those jokes were recycled from a news conference promoting the
live telecast of this show (Sunday night 9 on HBO), but no matter.
Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm
Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway.'' Looking
backward is. New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television
show the final performance in a two-month world tour. That amounts
to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he
will retire.
</P>
<P>
   These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they
say a lot about his past. He comes full circle here, back to the
stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in
the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended
with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act. On Broadway, that
act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed
and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and
his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he
worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines,
Iowa, he gave away all the tickets. Most shows on the tour sold
out; some didn't. But New York is home, the audience was primed to
adore him, and all he really had to do was show up. He did more.
Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled,
hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted
observations.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final
``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he
became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his
style of stand-up has become.
</P>
<P>
   He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so
purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's
with the cabbies and the b.o.?'' He went on to talk about the
lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions
given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt
in case you haven't been in a car since 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he
has already given away so many himself. It is nearly impossible to
give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that
he has none. ``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're
hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though,
``They've seen the fork.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than
sitcom Jerry ever was. And he makes more funny faces. He imitated a
turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as
well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey. ``That's the
look you have on your face when you're that close to being the
dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it.'' He
interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so
much that he lost control. To someone who threw a business card
with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read
it. I'm busy!''
</P>
<P>
   Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular,
relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines. His
opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the
comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic
energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool
Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately
retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine
in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a
bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable. The
HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and
unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld.'')
</P>
<P>
   On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live. When I screw
up, you see it.'' He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted
routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material
out to pasture. After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for
something new, maybe even risky.
</P>
<P>
   One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo
for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting
as his next career. He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas
while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll
go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out. ``How could
it not work out?'' he wonders. He looks goofily pleased with
himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of
something new. It may be a goof, but it holds promise.
