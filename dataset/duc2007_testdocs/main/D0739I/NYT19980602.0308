SCRIPT OF LAST `SEINFELD' TO BE AUCTIONED
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script,
filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and
bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television. But are
sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth
thousands of dollars?
</P>
<P>
   As they say on television, stay tuned. On June 18, little more
than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from
``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers''
and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction
the 68-page script with all the ``alrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93
season will go for $1,500 to $2,000. But some
television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta
Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could
easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood
collectibles is blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV scripts are fast becoming the pop art of the future,'' said
Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like
scripts and props from old shows. ``As you enter the new
millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become
what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate,
television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the
signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who
wrote it). On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible
autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost
unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that
introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the
23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that
`Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television
jargon as an original `table draft.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not
an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors
ad-libbed. Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes
dropped before the episode was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly
profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10
billion market for collectibles. Dealers say that prices for
television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated
1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an
unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended
the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,''
becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go
on the auction block. Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The
Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996. Again, value is tied to
autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners''
script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music
to `The White Album,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This
Is Your Life'' went for $1,150. Once again, autographs were
essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and
his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than
other film and television collectibles. A script for an episode of
``MASH,'' signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier
this year, it went for $4,000. A signed script from the NBC sitcom
``Friends'' that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.
And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running
sitcom went off the air in 1993. The owner recently put it on the
market for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said. ``While we were working on
it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the
original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer
Gene Roddenberry. The 26-page typewritten document describes the
spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars.'' Most of the
characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the
cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and
surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will
sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope
the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, he acknowledged. But not to worry, either. ``They're
going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said,
``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this
time. `Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with
the scripts.''
