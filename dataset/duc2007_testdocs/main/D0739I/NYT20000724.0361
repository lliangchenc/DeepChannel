   PASADENA, Calif. _ Actor Michael Richards is reed thin. Actor
John Goodman is not. But the two have something very much in
common: Each has a new sitcom on the fall schedule, and neither had
much to bring to show-and-tell at the TV critics' press tour in
Pasadena. After shooting pilot episodes, each has scrapped the
first draft and gone back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The
Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after
he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided
it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy.
Tim Meadows is leaving ``Saturday Night Live'' to join the cast.
William Devane is also on board.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, whose show for Fox remains untitled, will play William
``Butch'' Gamble Jr., a gay man who returns to his hometown in
Ohio, where his adult son and ex-wife still live. Aside from the
son, to be played by Greg Pitts, the Goodman show is still casting
about for the ex-wife, as well as for Butch's sister and her two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not unprecedented for a show to be pilotless in
July, it's often not a good sign. Fall-series production begins
just about now, so a show that's still trying to decide what it
wants to be has only a few weeks to set a course. Fortunately, the
fall season is late this year because of the summer Olympics,
pushing the premiere of Richards' show into October at the
earliest. Goodman's will be even later _ Nov. 1 _ because of Fox's
commitment to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, whose private persona is completely unlike the manic
Kramer he played on ``Seinfeld,'' seemed almost apologetic when he
asked critics to be patient. ``I'd like to say just stick with us.
We're working hard here, and I think you'll see something quite
special this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, meanwhile, remains ever sarcastic, with nary a clue
about what producers Bonnie and Terry Turner have in mind. ``I'm
right now kind of a hired-gun guy,'' he said. ``I'm waiting to see
how it shapes up before I start screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   As they say in TV, stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia, Wash., native Sonja Christopher, the first contestant
to be voted off the island in ``Survivor,'' is a little dismayed by
what she experienced in her short time on Pulau Tiga in the South
China Sea and by what she has seen of the program on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm a little naive,'' she confessed. ``I don't know
whether it's the younger generation or certain people in my tribe
or whatever, but I didn't do the `outwit' part of it very well. I
didn't even think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, who is 63, was referring to the three basic tenets
of ``Survivor'': to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the creation of power alliances on the island and
outright deception by at least two contestants when asked if such
alliances exist, she looked at producer Mark Burnett and said: ``I
hope the program doesn't teach the young people in America that the
way to win is to be duplicitous and dishonest. That's a concern of
mine.''
