   NEW YORK _ Only 18 months ago, NBC's executives were riding a
wave of prime-time success that had raised the network to
record-setting profits. The executives were so confident that they
were occasionally suggesting that they did not merely want to be
the No. 1 network; they wanted to be the only network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its
elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to
avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas,
when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on
the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits. Now, in
the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly
altered position: on the downside of dominance.
</P>
<P>
   As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to
counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could
not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the
ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers
and the internal executive turf battles. And once again the network
is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the
downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit
every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in
the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   If there were ever any doubts about the ratings clout of
``Seinfeld,'' they have now been erased. NBC's ratings are off by
more than 20 percent this fall, a figure surely higher than NBC
expected when it calculated how badly it would be hit by the
departure of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger
men, the biggest fans of ``Seinfeld.'' Some of that is also the
result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this
year. But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had
the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between
the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent. Among men
between 18 and 34 the figure grows to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is the state of play that the new executive, Scott Sassa,
encounters as he joins the network as the president of
entertainment. Sassa, 39, former head of all entertainment
operations for the Turner Broadcasting cable channels, was
appointed to replace the longtime NBC programmer, Warren
Littlefield, last week. NBC called the move the first step in a
planned transition that would bring Sassa into total control of NBC
entertainment operations.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a year he will work under Don Ohlmeyer, the
executive brought in the last time NBC, a unit of General Electric,
faced a clouding-over prime-time picture. That was in 1993, and
things were much worse then. Ohlmeyer, who is now widely credited
with providing the leadership that turned NBC around, had to start
almost from scratch. NBC's executive reorganization this time comes
at a far earlier point in NBC's ratings decline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior NBC executives acknowledge that they must make
moves now to level off the network; and they believe they can.
NBC's position remains reasonably secure for the moment, because no
other network is making a strong upward movement that would help
force NBC down further, and because NBC still possesses a core of
television's strongest shows _ ``E.R.,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends''
and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC is also embroiled in a bitter standoff with the
Hollywood studios that supply all those hits. NBC has demanded an
ownership stake in all new programs and the studios have refused.
Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC. For
the moment, that means those studios will not be supplying NBC with
any of the hits the network needs to pull out of its current slide.
</P>
<P>
   NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no
compelling new program has been added to NBC's store. Network
executives concede that program development has been weak and no
real hits have emerged in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered
last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the
problems for a time.
</P>
<P>
   The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what
several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves,
such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule
with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies
generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind
of programming. Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its
Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
</P>
<P>
   That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles
as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by
the rest of the program department.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked. Reflecting a
widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing
network suggested a couple of reasons for this. ``It was a
combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise
and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a
female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding,
usually in New York. The list of shows with that premise introduced
by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the
City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and
``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between
``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R.'' _ arguably the most advantageous place to
build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
</P>
<P>
   But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC
executive said. ``It just didn't work. And it meant we wasted that
9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could
help replace it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced
to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where
``Seinfeld'' lived. That did help shore up Thursday, which has been
NBC's stronghold for almost two decades. But in so doing, NBC
drastically weakened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on
Tuesdays. Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy
hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season. With some
stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back
of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one
hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore! Encore!'' That is being pointed to
as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not
let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it
down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of
shows on the air. ``Encore! Encore!'' was produced because NBC had
a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged
another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped
would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' is far from the only failure in the current
fall crop, however. One drama, ``Wind on Water,'' has already been
canceled. Another, ``Trinity'' (created as a result of a deal with
the producer of ``E.R.''), is endangered. Another comedy, ``Conrad
Bloom,'' is listing badly on Mondays. Only ``Will and Grace,'' a
comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some
signs of promise.
</P>
<P>
   But that may only be because it has been up against weak
competition. When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy,
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' against ``Will and Grace'' last week,
the show took a big fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to
succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot
now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant
disappointment. But several senior NBC executives said the network
could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast
this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company,
Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of
``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out
its profitability for NBC. The enormous cost of that deal hardened
NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new
shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve
its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need
to. ``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, however, seemed to signal that he would take steps to
resolve the standoff. And another senior NBC executive said,
``Scott will solve that.'' What Sassa will do to solve the drought
of hits is less certain. The cupboard is all but bare at the
moment, with only two possible replacement series in production.
And neither of those, a comedy, ``Lateline,'' and a drama,
``Providence,'' is thought to resemble a cavalry charge.
</P>
<P>
   Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC
might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup
of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being. One show
several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third
Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as
a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew
Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
</P>
<P>
   NBC might also consider returning the Monday night
made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing
it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping
some of its weak Monday comedies. But the movies that filled that
slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get
any stockpile of movies established.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer is expected to take a much more hands-on role in
developing the next batch of NBC shows while Sassa learns the
details of running the entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa himself refused to say in what direction he planned to
take NBC programming. ``I can't give you the secrets to the nuclear
code,'' he said.
