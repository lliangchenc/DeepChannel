   PASADENA, Calif. _ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing
professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing. One
moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat:
The Next Wave on a D-list network. The next, he's resurrecting his
recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie
Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry
Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
</P>
<P>
   And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a
higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and
clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's
really no announcement at all.
</P>
<P>
   Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be
wrapped up by the time I make it home.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a
business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre
art form in itself. That no matter how much talent you have, or how
decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're
perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Read on and this might make sense yet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone. In fact, he hasn't
even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy
series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny
punch line in a Honda TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked
up the story. And as one cable executive said while reading the
blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld
Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in
serious talks by now.''
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a
young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an
afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a
few hours, becomes the hottest director in town. Why? Because he
didn't return phone calls. Not because he's juggling the many deals
pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect. He was
part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment
Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who
toiled on Seinfeld. Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the
only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely
pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only
spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority
characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black
character.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment,
and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a
life of its own. Which, of course, it did.
</P>
<P>
   In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for
truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company
town, and though there are certainly talented people working and
creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content
and progression without talent.
</P>
<P>
   It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their
share of the pie. For example: Despite his striking leading-man
looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling
until David E. Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally
McBeal playing Ally's (Calista Flockhart's) love interest. Martin's
buzz came not during his episodes but after his character returned
after being written out. Sensing that audience reaction convinced
Kelley to bring Martin back, networks started falling over
themselves to sign the actor to development deals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox seemingly had the inside track, but once Benjamin Bratt
exited Dick Wolf's Law &AMP; Order, NBC came up with the best offer: a
key spot on a stable, creatively satisfying series.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tea Leoni, a former ``it'' girl who came to our
attention as the good-time girl in the Fox comedy Flying Blind and
nearly immediately landed in the disastrous The Naked Truth. She's
now out of TV.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman's similar tale had a more positive result. She was
jobless after the Molly Ringwald-led sitcom Townies, in which she
co-starred, flopped. But not for long. This could be debated, but
it seems Elfman raised her stature when, during a promotional party
for ABC stars, she leapt on the stage at the House of Blues and
danced, if you want to call it that.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the statuesque, slinky Elfman became a hot
commodity _ and ABC gave her a sitcom, Dharma &AMP; Greg.
</P>
<P>
   Will Morris actually do a sitcom based on Jackie Chiles? The
wait will be interesting. Or did his comments have about as much
validity as the cabbie who tried to convince me that CBS is sitting
on a sitcom script of his, one about a taxi driver and the wacky
people who parade in and out of his back seat?
</P>
<P>
   My advice? Don't return phone calls.
