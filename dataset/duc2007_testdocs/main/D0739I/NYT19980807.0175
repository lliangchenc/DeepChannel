   LOS ANGELES _ During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld
was asked what it was like to end the run of his hit comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever take a dog into the park and take his leash off,
and he kind of looks up at you for a second and then just bolts
like a maniac?'' he asked. ``Something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but
before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time,
the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Seinfeld is going to bury the act with a live HBO
special called ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time.'' (It's tape
delayed on the West Coast.)
</P>
<P>
   The comedian has vowed that after tonight's performance he would
``never do any of these jokes again,'' and said he plans to start
working on an all-new act, though it may take eight months to a
year, ``depending on how hard I work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Seinfeld has been polishing his show on a
tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland, Australia,
England, Kansas City and Des Moines. He made an unpublicized
appearance at the Comedy &AMP; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach a few weeks
ago. On Wednesday, he began a 10-performance run at the Broadhurst
Theatre on Broadway that ends with tonight's show.
</P>
<P>
   As for why he decided to tour rather than take some time off,
Seinfeld said it was much more appealing than the usual vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in front of an audience is the most fun I can have,'' he
said. ``I've been on beaches. I've been on boats. It's pleasant,
but it's not really a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld is clearly enjoying himself on this tour,and performing
before his hometown crowd in New York City is especially rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York audiences have always been the best for me, because
humor is really a New York invention, as far as I'm concerned,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld isn't likely to pull any surprises tonight, though
reports say the material varies slightly from show to show. He is
at heart a Borscht Belt-style stand-up comedian who polishes his
material to a brilliant shine; his strength is wry, witty
observations. You'll see no wild, raw improv antics a la Robin
Williams. Neither will he go into a prolonged character, as Billy
Crystal or Whoopi Goldberg do in their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld is most comfortable being himself. He did, as you
remember, play a character for nine years named Jerry Seinfeld on
his hit series. The comedian's schtick, for the most part, is his
puzzlement and amusement over the absurdities of modern life. And
his look at the end of a joke, which combines a slight bewilderment
at the ridiculousness of a situation along with a bit of smug
superiority because he's aware of it, is what endears him to
audiences who feel the same way. (``Oh yeah,'' you're thinking as
you're laughing, ``I noticed that.'')
</P>
<P>
   The reviews of the tour and the Broadway performances have been
mostly positive. And even if the material is likely to be familiar
to fans, it isn't likely to stop anyone from laughing. One Midwest
critic started off by carping that a better title for the concert
would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've Heard This One,'' but throughout
the rest of the review repeated a lot of the show's jokes (we won't
do that) and talked about how much the audience enjoyed itself.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. ``Seinfeld'' reruns in syndication do handsomely.
Good jokes, after all, are hard to find, which makes tonight's
show, if Seinfeld keeps his promise, a keeper for anyone with a
VCR. (It will be repeated at 9:30 p.m. Sept. 12.) For those of you
who don't, the material will also be included on his upcoming
Universal Records album of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, one of the people watching those syndicated
reruns is Seinfeld himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were very funny, the ones that I saw,'' he
said. ``I found them very, very entertaining. I was upset that the
show went off the air when I saw them.''
