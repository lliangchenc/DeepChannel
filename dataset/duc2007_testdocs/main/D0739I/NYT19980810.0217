JERRY SEINFELD 
I'm telling you for the last time: Live on Broadway 
On HBO last night

   &UR;  &LR; Some people never can say goodbye. But not Jerry Seinfeld. In
the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely
successful sitcom after nine years. And Sunday night, live from New
York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up
material he has cultivated so far in his career.
</P>

   While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last
Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes
for the first time. Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that
bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly
encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational
gags split among at least three other jokers. Sunday night, wearing
a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood
alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his
charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house. At one point,
a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib
``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the
rest of the audience _ ``see other people.'' Miraculously, he
managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO
special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final
performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.

   Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the
strangeness of ordinary things. Always obsessed with hygiene, he
spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body
odor. ``How long are these shifts?'' he exclaimed. He thought out
loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense
their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific
expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the
cows tip them off when they're millking them.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprise was the physicality of his performance. It was
Michael Richards as Kramer &UR;  &LR; who provided most of the visual humor
on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body
and facial expressions to tell his stories. He mimicked the way
flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat
belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits. He did an
impression of a wolf man shaving. And in a riff about a forthcoming
visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out
of a driveway without looking.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even
edgy. In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight
Show'' feel to it. There was no envelope pushing, no Robin
Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his
unusual sensibility. But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like
the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out. The
show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy,
now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled
film set in a graveyard. As a group of very familiar faces of
comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling,
George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno,
Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at
least.
