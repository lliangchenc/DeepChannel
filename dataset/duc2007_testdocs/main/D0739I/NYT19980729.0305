   (OMAHA, Neb.) _ His short tour of the Midwest is a dress
rehearsal for a cable TV show he'll call ``I'm Telling You for the
Last Time,'' but a better title would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've
Heard This One.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian
Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on his old standup routine,
preparing for a finale in his hometown, New York City, that will be
aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9. ``After that,'' he has
promised, ``I won't use that material ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in the lovely and historic Orpheum Theater
(downtown Omaha's version of the Midland Theatre), Seinfeld
delivered a 75-minute medley of his greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, which seats about 2,800 people, was nearly full for
the second of four shows at the Orpheum last weekend. The Omaha
World-Herald , however, reported Friday that the event's promoter,
Contemporary Productions, had given away an average of 500 tickets
per show, mostly to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited the $60.50 ticket price as the reason for
slightly sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price, the familiar routines and a few rough spots
(his transitions need sanding and polishing), most of the crowd
reacted as if each joke had been baked fresh that day. Maybe, like
most ``Seinfeld'' fans, they're accustomed to laughing at reruns.
There were plenty of those:
</P>
<P>
   - On why men don't like to write checks: ``To men, a check is
like a note from your mother. A check says, `Sorry, I don't have
any money with me right now, but if you contact these people,
they'll give you the amount of money I wish I had.' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On bathrooms in airplanes: ``There's a slot for used razor
blades. What I want to know is, who is shaving on the airplane? And
shaving so much that they're using up razor blades. Is the Wolfman
on the plane?''
</P>
<P>
   - On the rubber divider at the grocery checkout: ``We use the
rubber divider because we don't want someone else's items
fraternizing with our own. The rubber divider is the universal
signal for `Back off!' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On the high price of candy at movie theaters: ``That's why
they put it in a jewelry case. You feel like you're buying a
diamond: `Excuse me, I'd like to see something in a Milk Dud.' And
then they bring you one Milk Dud on a black velvet pillow ...''
</P>
<P>
   - On pain relievers: ``Everything is `extra-strength' now. You
can't even get `strength' anymore; `strength' is off the market.
But for some people, extra-strength isn't enough. They need
`maximum strength,' which is like telling the drug companies,
`Figure out how much will kill me, pull back a little and give me
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On skydiving: ``What exactly is the helmet for? Let me tell
you, if you're skydiving and your parachute doesn't open, your
helmet is wearing you for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   - On dating: ``A date is a job interview that lasts all night.
The only difference: There's no chance you'll end up naked at the
end of a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the evening, Seinfeld delivered some newer (or
lesser-known) material _ and more evidence of his comic brilliance.
Like few other comedians (a younger George Carlin comes to mind),
Seinfeld examines the enduring quirks and oddball habits that
afflict so many of us in the Western world. `Seinfeld' was more
about everything _ about so many of our common behavioral tics _
than about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as he talked about men and how ``in their own minds
they live lives of super heroes,'' he sketched this observation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you have seen this: a guy driving down the street with
a mattress or box spring tied to the top of his car, and he's got
his arm out the window and he's holding on to the mattress _ with
one arm. Here's what this guy is thinking: If a big gust of wind
were to catch the mattress and lift it, breaking the rope, he'll be
able to hold the mattress to the roof _ with one arm _ and prevent
it from flying off the car. `It's OK; I got it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his encore, Seinfeld spent several minutes taking questions
and a few gifts from his audience: ``Will you do movies?'' ``I
don't think so. You watch a bad movie, it only costs you two hours.
You do a bad movie, it costs you two years.''
</P>
<P>
   When a woman presented a bouquet of flowers to him, he said,
``Thank you very much. But you know what most men think (when) they
get flowers from a woman? `Oh, great. Now I gotta take care of
these.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the show by following his own advice (to his TV buddy
George): Leave on a high note. After someone from the back of the
balcony bellowed, ``Hello, Jerry,'' Seinfeld let rip with a
``Hello, Newman'' that brought most of the house screaming to its
feet.
