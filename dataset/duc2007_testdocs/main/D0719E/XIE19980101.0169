<HEADLINE> Chirac Gives New Year Good Wish Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
gave this evening his New Year good wish message to the French
people, in which he stressed the need to fight crimes and
unemployment in France.
</P>
<P>
In his first public address to the nation since he began to
co-habit with the leftwing parliament majority in June, Chirac
also appealed to the French people for a rally in preparation for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-four months only separate us from the year 2000. Time
is speeding, changes multiplying, mentalities evolving, and
frontiers becoming blurred. We live in a time of uncertainty and
difficulty, but also rich of promises and possibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there exists too much violence in schools, streets
and in public transport, which has become one top worry of the
French people together with unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Each day, the limits are broken beyond which the society will
break up. It is today, I know, with unemployment, your primary
worry," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government would play its role in cracking
down crimes and punish those who break the law, which he said is
the primary guarantee of freedom.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all French citizens to take up their
responsibilities to protect the republic values of France and be
attached to the principle of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the extreme-right National Front,
Chirac called on the French people to reject all the ideas which
endanger the unity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is never and will never be the addition of
communities existing one by the side of another. The public
balance sheet is never and will never be of particular interests,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called on the French people to better contribute to
the construction of the European Union by becoming more flexible
in their way of thinking and more creative.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a French ambition: free the force and the
energy of our people, create the conditions of richness and
activity so that all Frenchmen can profit from it by creating more
jobs," he said.
