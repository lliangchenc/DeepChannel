<HEADLINE> OECD Calls on France to Adopt More Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today called on France to adopt
more flexible socio-economic policies in its on-going structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today,
the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to
the French government over economic growth and cutting public
deficits.
</P>
<P>
It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5
percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit
could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This means that the aim by the French government to attain the
Maastricht deficit limit for joining the European single currency,
the euro, is within reach, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the real problem France is faced with is not
only "cyclical" but also "structural."
</P>
<P>
France is greatly lagging behind other OECD countries in
flexibility and de-regulation, especially in budgetary policy and
the role played by the state in the country's economy, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It said that as France's public spending is one of the highest
among OECD countries in terms of its GDP, it is inevitable for the
country to vigorously continue the process of the reform of public
spendings.
</P>
<P>
The OECD called on France to pay attention to the reform of its
public sector management, pointing out that many other OECD
countries have more flexible public sector management.
</P>
<P>
It also called on France to pursue the reform of public
spending "beyond Maastricht."
</P>
<P>
"In view of demographic changes, which would suggest that
spending pressures are likely to build up after the year 2000,
further public spending cuts will probably prove necessary," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which
stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the "substantial structural
impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
</P>
<P>
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over
the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while
the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of
the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural
unemployment.
