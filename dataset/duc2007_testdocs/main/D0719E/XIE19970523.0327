<HEADLINE> Blair to Warn EU Partners Against Higher Costs on Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair is
to tell his European Union (EU) partners that he would stand in
the way of attempts to introduce higher social costs in Britain,
according to British government sources.
</P>
<P>
At the special EU summit to be held in the Dutch city Noordwijk
on Friday, Blair will say that although the new British government
is planning to sign up to the Social Chapter, it is also
determined to insist that the 15-nation bloc move to flexible
labor markets, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on the May 1
general election, is expected to press the case for Europe to move
towards the policies that have encouraged overseas firms to choose
Britain as a base for investment.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old new British Prime Minister will tell the other
EU leaders that there is a third way between the Tory-style
non-intervention and the kind of over-regulation that is blamed
for imposing extra costs and higher unemployment on France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to make it clear at the summit that he will
not allow the Social Chapter to become a means of backdoor
imposition on Britain of European legislation on social security
and worker involvement on company boards.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative government official was quoted as saying
today: "We don't want to lose control of our social security
costs. We would veto such extra costs being imposed here."
