<HEADLINE> Demonstration Staged in Lyon Against G-7 Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, France, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred people took
part in the demonstration here today against the policies of the
world's most developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place when leaders of the group of seven (G-7)
industrialized nations gathered in this southeastern French city
for a three-day summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful demonstration, organized by a group of 53
non-governmental organizations, consisted of a series of speeches
at Lyon's city labor exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The G-7 presents itself as the pilot of the general ship of
world affairs, thus it places itself in a situation of power and
responsibility," said Nigerian Nobel Literature Prize laureate
Wole Soyinka, who chaired the event.
</P>
<P>
"However," Soyinka noted, the group's collective course
"militates against the well-being of the majority of peoples."
</P>
<P>
This, he added, is "leading to mass unemployment, a widening
gap between the North and the South and even more profoundly
between the affluent and the poor in every society."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the members of the G-7 to take stock of their
power and its failures, to be aware of the consequences of the
policies that they set in motion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the
G-7 summit, which drew here leaders from France, the United
States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan.
