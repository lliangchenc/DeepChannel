WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Resulting from different
employment policies, U.S. unemployment has dropped by almost half
in the past 15 years while most of major Western nations have
shown a strong rise with little sign of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said today that the long-term trends emerge
from detailed figures that the U.S. Labor Department has just
published.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the U.S. joblessness peaked at 9.7
percent in 1982, the first full year of President Reagan's
administration. It declined steadily for the next seven years,
then rose again to 7.5 percent in 1992 when President Clinton was
elected.
</P>
<P>
Then it dropped again, hovering in recent months around the 5.6
percent level it reached last year. It stood at 5.4 percent in
July.
</P>
<P>
But Japan, which kept its unemployment rate as low as below 2
percent in 1960s and early 1970s, breaking that barrier only in
1976. A slow, steady rise over two decades pushed it over 3.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
France and especially West Germany also had a history of
keeping unemployment low in the 1960s and early 1970s. But in
1975, West German unemployment more than doubled to 3.4 percent.
And joblessness in France also rose sharply to 4.2 percent from
2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since then West Germany's rise has continued, reaching 6.5
percent last year with the percentage in the former East Germany
not being included.
</P>
<P>
French unemployment reached 11.5 percent last year and Italy's
12 percent, more than twice the U.S. rate. Figures for Japan,
Germany, France and Italy have continued to edge up in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the only major European country whose joblessness
peaked at 11.8 percent in 1983 and dropped to 8.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There's a different focus of the government, especially in
France, Germany and Italy," said Mark Anderson, director of
international trade for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "they focus more on a fairer distribution of
income and not throwing someone on the street to work for whatever
wage he or she can get."
</P>
<P>
European governments worry a lot about unemployment, but have
failed to reverse the upward trend, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday a new French law went into effect that encourages
businesses to cut working hours and hire more workers. But the
paper said that many economists doubt if it will work.
