<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California has
gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing
that one third of state voters still don't recognize his name.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell campaign officials said they planned to unleash ads
this summer that will help the moderate congressman turn the
numbers around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet begun to fight,'' said Campbell senior
strategist Sean
</P>
<P>
   Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville,
Md., showed Feinstein with a formidable 57 percent to 34 percent
lead among those who had picked their choice for U.S. Senate if the
election were held today. The poll also showed that 26 percent of
Republicans said they preferred Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley congressman is ``the kind of Republican who
could win a statewide election, but I don't see a scenario where
Campbell could pull off an upset,'' said Ali, whose firm conducted
the poll July 17 through 19. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were posed to 827 registered voters who vote
regularly in state elections. Republicans and Democrats were
divided equally.
</P>
<P>
   Add to Campbell's weak name recognition a bustling economy and
voter approval for Feinstein, and the congressman appears to face
even more of an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incumbents get too much credit when things go well and too
much blame when things go bad. It's a good election cycle to be an
incumbent,'' said Ali. ``It always starts with the economic times.
You've got a job, money in the bank, and people feel secure.
They're not going to rock the boat by throwing out the status
quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, he added, ``would almost have to go out and try to
lose the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to fulfill the
last two years of a six-year term. When she stood for re-election
in 1994, she narrowly beat back a challenge from Republican Michael
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   This is Campbell's second stint in Congress. He served as a U.S.
representative between 1988 and 1992. He returned to Congress in a
special election in 1995 after a brief term in the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   He narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. Senate primary in 1992 to
ultra-conservative Bruce Herschenson, who in turn was defeated in
the general election by liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer _ a race
many observers believed Campbell would have won had he faced her.
</P>
<P>
   The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks
before
</P>
<P>
   California's March primary, when Feinstein had 54 percent to
Campbell's 36
</P>
<P>
   percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's poll shows Feinstein doing slightly better than
Campbell among men _ 48 to 44 percent _ and far better _ 65 to 24
percent _ among women.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows the senator from San Francisco ahead in
every region of the state except for the Central Valley, where each
received 44 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was far ahead of Campbell among ethnic groups and
Caucasians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is a pro-abortion rights Republican who sells himself
as fiscally conservative but socially more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein scored a 57 percent favorable rating, compared to a 23
percent rating for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the School of Politics
and Economics at Claremont Graduate University said Feinstein
probably earned points among Democrats and Republicans alike by
coming out early in her criticisms of President Clinton's affair
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed her independence and values and toughness. Voters
appreciate that even if the people who work with her do not,'' said
Jeffe. ``She doesn't toe an ideological partisan line and that's
where voters are these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the Campbell campaign was gearing up for an
aggressive race, and
</P>
<P>
   planned to start defining the soft-spoken congressman long
before Labor Day, the unofficial kickoff day for the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Campbell has been called ``the smartest man in
Congress'' by Roll Call magazine. But he acknowledged: ``We have to
raise his name ID and profile.''
