FEINSTEIN'S SILENCE SPEAKS LOUDLY ABOUT THE CLINTON AFFAIR

   WASHINGTON _ Whether President Clinton corrupted Monica Lewinsky
is a subject for clergymen. That he has corrupted the language in
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   Caught having sex with the intern, he denied having ``sexual
relations.'' It's the listener's fault, he insisted last month on
national television, for not catching his drift. He regretted
having ``misled'' us.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of September has brought a new cargo of verbal
rubble. It was not until Friday that the man who admitted to a
liaison that was ``not appropriate'' could be coaxed to utter the
two words that properly express an apology. Again, the blame for
the failed communication is hung on the listener. From Moscow, a
disappointed Clinton says that he has gone to the trouble of
re-reading his Aug. 17 televised speech to the nation and can find
no deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it must be the listener's fault.
</P>
<P>
   If the man in the Oval Office remains tongued-tied about his
behavior during all those 18 months in the room adjoining the Oval
Office _ and all those seven months of brazen cover-up _ another
American leader is teaching us the power of a few words spoken with
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was present in the Roosevelt Room in January when the
president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica
Lewinsky. I believed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense of sadness
in that my trust in his credibility had been badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Sen. Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the
president's address on Aug. 17. Feinstein, D-Calif., has issued no
public statement since. On the hottest topic in Washington, she has
refused to give journalists what they desire most: words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, followed as it has been by these weeks of heavy silence,
Feinstein's statement continues to echo, just as Clinton's can
still be heard, thanks to the unforgiving videotape, making that
dreadful, point-of-no-return denial back in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I want to say one thing to the American people,'' Clinton
said, his finger pointing into the camera like an Uncle Sam ``I
WANT YOU'' poster. ``I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say
this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman ...
Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   To Feinstein, those unforgettable, unretractable words were not
those of a politician denying something for which he was
embarrassed. They were the words of a political contract: I'm
telling you the truth. Now, you go out and defend me.
</P>
<P>
   Today Clinton must contend with the outrage of those who spent
winter, spring and summer honoring their end of that contract _
only to learn it was all a sham. In this twilight struggle, the
senator from California has been especially eloquent, conveying the
disquiet of her soul in the quiet of her bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Such discretion is enviable in today's climate. Where Feinstein
has avoided the contamination of the Lewinsky Affair, others have
not been so lucky. She has learned the hard way that once a few
words have been spoken on this sordid affair, the surest way to
protect your honor is to keep your distance; the best way to
declare your outrage is to keep an impressive silence.
