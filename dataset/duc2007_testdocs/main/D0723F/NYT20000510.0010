 FEINSTEIN INTRODUCES GUN-LICENSE LEGISLATION  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that the power of a million moms can
defeat the gun lobby, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced
legislation Tuesday to require that gun owners obtain licenses and
register their firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began
traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National
Mall in support of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us
the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I
think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senator's legislation would impose requirements
on gun owners similar to those that exist for drivers. Owners of
handguns, and semiautomatic firearms that use detachable magazines,
would need licenses, which would cost $25. All sales of such
weapons would be recorded and the information transmitted to the
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to say enough is enough and demand of
Congress the passage of commonsense gun laws,'' Feinstein said in a
Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was joined by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and they stood before an oversized photograph
of 10 children being led by police away from a Los Angeles day care
center after a shooting there last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting
license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But when
you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary,'' Feinstein said.
``That makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the
making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of
galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun
forces in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group,
its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and
said licensing and registration is their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Several far more modest gun control measures _ including
legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to
minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows _ were
passed by the Senate last year. However, they were not approved by
the House and are now languishing in a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost
no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most
powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,''
she said, ``and this is the women in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change
if Democrats prevail in November's election.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least
100,000 _ and perhaps as many as 250,000 _ supporters to the
National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off
rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally
begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue,
a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold
a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by
guns every year. Organizers said they ``want to show the American
public that not all women are pro-gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   The two marches will be on opposite sides of the Washington
Monument. The Million Mom March will go east from the monument to
the Capitol, while the Armed Informed Mothers' March will go west
toward the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia-Hupp will be the keynote speaker
at the pro-gun march. Gratia-Hupp was in a restaurant in Killeen,
Texas, in 1991 when a lone gunman killed 21 people in a shooting
spree, including her parents. She said she believes she could have
saved lives, had she been armed, by shooting the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Only two politicians will speak at the gun control rally:
Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed by a
gunman on a Long Island commuter train, and Maryland Lt. Gov.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, whose father, Robert, was assassinated
32 years ago as he ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's news conference included harrowing stories from
individuals whose families have been shattered by guns.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Perry of Washington, D.C., told of a 3 a.m. phone call
in which she learned the son of a close friend had been shot dead
in the back and of her agonizing conversation informing the mother.
</P>
<P>
   As tears welled up in her eyes, and rolled down the cheeks of
many others gathered in Senate hearing room, she talked of the
misery inflicted on thousands of families and the loss of freedom
for so many kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk to me about your right to carry a firearm,'' she
said, warning lawmakers that they have a choice of either ``signing
on to active gun control legislation or signing out in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun supporters mocked Feinstein's proposed restrictions, saying
they would be followed only by law-abiding citizens and not by the
criminals who terrorize the public with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are fundamentally skeptical that gun
regulation will reduce violent crimes. They favor strict
enforcement of the existing laws,'' said Jim Manown, a spokesman
for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is familiar with the landscape of the Congress
knows that this bill isn't is  &LR; going anywhere,'' Manown said,
accusing Feinstein of engaging in little more than a publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the senator ever chooses to leave public service, she will
have a sterling career as a publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has been a foe of the gun lobby since she was San
Francisco's mayor nearly two decades ago and sponsored a citywide
handgun ban that was approved by the Board of Supervisors but
ultimately struck down by a state court. In 1994, as a first-term
senator, she pushed through a ban on assault weapons.
