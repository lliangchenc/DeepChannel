   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell,
conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton
administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting
ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies
that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Mexican drug cartels must be targeted ``like a
laser beam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cartels of Mexico today are stronger than Mafia organized
crime ever was and I believe they represent a threat to the U.S.,''
Feinstein told a news conference. ``Our enemies should be the
cartels, not Mexico vs. the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein stressed that she doesn't want to hurt trade or
friendship with Mexico and that she believes top Mexican government
officials are ``doing their level best'' to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, D-Calif., and Coverdell, R-Ga., have led past
unsuccessful Senate efforts to override administration
certifications of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the bill would focus on ``bad actors'' in Mexico,
as opposed to seeking to override the administration's decision to
certify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're not decertifying Mexico, we're decertifying the
cartels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he and Feinstein ``adamantly oppose'' efforts to
repeal the law that requires the administration to give annual
certifications to Congress that Mexico or other nations with
drug-trafficking histories are cooperating in the U.S. war against
drugs. If a foreign country loses an annual certification, it could
risk losing U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell acknowledged that Congress won't repeal the
certification of Mexico this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Feinstein-Coverdell proposal targets foreign narcotics
dealers considered a threat to U.S. national security. It would
freeze the assets of drug traffickers and ban their related
businesses _ either front businesses or those run from drug profits
_ from trading with American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would
draw up a list of narcotics traffickers and impose criminal
penalties of up to $500,000 per violation or $250,000 and up to 10
years in prison for American companies that do business with them.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the U.S. government has targeted and financially
crippled a drug store chain, a poultry business and pharmaceutical
laboratories connected to drug cartels.

   Meanwhile, efforts were continuing in the House to strip Mexico
of its certification.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Feb. 26 certified to Congress that Mexico
is a fully cooperating drug-fighting ally. Congress has 30 days
from that date to overturn the president's decision, a prospect
that seems highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's certification has been renewed 13 times since 1986 when
the annual process went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. John Mica, R-Fla., Clay E. Shaw Jr., R-Fla., and Spencer
Bachus, R-Ala., introduced a resolution Tuesday to decertify Mexico
in what they said was a first step toward overturning the
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Mica said America is ``on the verge of having a state to the
south of us that is an ally become a narco-terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachus called Clinton's decision to certify Mexico ``a sham.''
``To certify Mexico is to make a mockery out of the certification
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bachus acknowledged he faced ``an uphill battle,'' and said he
has no assurances that the House will actually vote on the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said this year's recertification
``cheapens and degrades'' the work and sacrifices that other
countries are making to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The following countries are subject to the re-certification
process: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil,
Burma, Cambodia, China, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and
Vietnam.
