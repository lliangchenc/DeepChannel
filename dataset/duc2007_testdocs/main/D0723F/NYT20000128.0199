   WASHINGTON _ With one arm around each of the grandmothers of
Elian Gonzalez, Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday reassured them that
American law is on their side and predicted their grandson will be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela
Quintana, Feinstein described them as ``heartbroken'' and
``sobbing'' and said she would do ``whatever I can'' to protect
their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just spent some time with two women who were very
intimidated, very fearful and very concerned,'' Feinstein,
D-Calif., said outside her Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandmothers should not have to go through this and politics
should not enter into it,'' she said. ``I believe that justice is
going to find its way. I just hope it's soon because politics and
political movements shouldn't use children to meet their
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the
American relatives of Elian Gonzalez, 6, to return the boy to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the time, was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat
carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother, her
boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, the Florida nun whose Miami Beach home was
used earlier in the week for a meeting between the boy and his
grandmothers abruptly threw off her impartiality and came out in
favor of keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with members of Congress in Washington,
Dominican Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said: ``The child has been in
the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of
political agendas. Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin also met with Attorney General Jane Reno in hopes of
persuading her to withdraw the INS order to send the boy back to
Cuba. But Reno, who oversees the immigration agency, refused to
budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe, based on all the information available
to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared with me,
that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving
parent _ his father,'' Reno said in a statement released after the
meeting.The grandmothers spent a third day Friday meeting with
lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Besides Feinstein, the women met with
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and
George R. Nethercutt Jr., R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and
immigration policies are on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has a father who loves him and has a home for him in
Cuba. In our society there are basic rights _ that includes the
right of a father to have a son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein called congressional efforts to grant Elian Gonzalez
citizenship so he can remain with his Florida relatives are
``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are fighting to prevent his
return to Cuba, arguing that it was the wish of his mother for the
boy to live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, however, said ``a gold chain, a baseball cap, a trip
to Disney Land and American razzle-dazzle'' are confusing the
6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   She added that if the Cuban boy returns home and the father
decides to bring Elian back to the United States ``on his own
volition, that's another story.''
