   Among the speakers on Monday evening's program:
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Californians made history by pulling the lever for both
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. In her eight years in
Washington, Feinstein, a native Californian and the former mayor of
San Francisco, has quietly pushed for anti-crime legislation and
issues close to home. One of her biggest victories was attaching an
assault weapons ban to the crime bill passed by President Clinton
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is a strong abortion rights advocate who has vigorously
fought the ban on partial birth abortion. Boxer is linked to the
Clinton White House by the marriage of Hillary Rodham Clinton's
brother, Tony Rodham, to her daughter, Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland
</P>
<P>
   After organizing neighbors to protest the construction of a
16-lane highway through the historic Fells Point area of Baltimore,
Barbara Mikulski plunged into politics in the late 1960s. Then a
social worker, Mikulski went on to serve as City Councilwoman in
her hometown of Baltimore, before serving in the House from 1976 to
1986 and being elected to the Senate in 1986. She is also the
co-author of two mystery novels with a political twist. ``Capitol
Offense'' and ``Capitol Virtues'' sketch the life of a freshman
female senator from Pennsylvania who Mikulski has called a
``somewhat younger, somewhat slimmer, but no less politically
savvy'' version of herself.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana
</P>
<P>
   Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996, and with Sen. John Breaux of
Louisiana, she forms the last of the all-Democratic Senate
delegations in the South. Landrieu grew up in New Orleans, the
oldest of nine children of Moon Landrieu, the mayor of the city in
the 1970s. In 1979, after graduating from Louisiana State
University, she became, at 23, the youngest woman ever elected to
the state Legislature. She was elected to the Senate in 1996, with
a moderate platform.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a rice farm in Helena, Ark., Blanche Lambert
Lincoln, 39, was elected to the Senate two years ago. After serving
two terms in the House, she took a two-year leave from public life
because she was about to give birth to twin boys. When she ran for
the Senate in 1998, she put their pictures on her campaign posters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1996, Debbie Stabenow is involved in
what is shaping up to be one of the nation's most bitterly
contested Senate races. She is challenging Sen. Spencer Abraham by
highlighting her own legislative record that goes back to 1975,
when she became county commissioner by fighting a proposal that
would have shut down a local hospital that accepted Medicaid.
