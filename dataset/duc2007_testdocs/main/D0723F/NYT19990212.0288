<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three weeks of lobbying and 25 different
versions of a censure resolution condemning President Clinton but
not convicting him, Sen. Dianne Feinstein still couldn't find the
magic language.
</P>
<P>
   Every time she used tougher words to win Republican support, she
would lose Democrats. When she softened the language, she would
lose Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she couldn't muster the 67 votes needed to allow a
floor vote on her resolution. Censure was as dead as the House
campaign to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything caused problems, every preposition, every
adjective, every adverb,'' Feinstein said Friday. ``We tried to
incorporate every suggestion everybody made but it seemed we lost
support on one side every time we picked it up on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to
bring up her censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposed censure because he
thought it was unconstitutional, blocked her with a parliamentary
tactic. She needed 67 votes to overcome Gramm and allow a vote on
the resolution. But she only received 56 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Feinstein's resolution was placed into the
Congressional Record but not adopted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not come up again,'' Feinstein said later,
acknowledging that ``people want to get past this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a point, because we got the resolution into the Record
signed by one-third'' of the Senate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated that, as
far as he was concerned, the matter was closed and the Senate would
not take up censure again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I
think, the Senate is tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that since a vote on censure
wasn't allowed Friday, ``Now is the time to stop. Let the
recriminations stop. It's going to take a while to put some of
these pieces back together.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final form, her three-page censure resolution, signed by
38 senators, condemned Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and
indefensible'' behavior in connection with his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It said Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American
people,'' ``gave false or misleading testimony'' which ``had the
effect of impeding discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Clinton's conduct demeaned the office of the
president and ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign for censure was aided by Sens. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., Robert Bennett, R-Utah and Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who didn't sign Feinstein's
censure resolution but voted Friday to allow it to come up for
debate, praised her colleague's efforts in tackling such a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Feinstein deserves a lot of credit,'' Boxer said. ``It
shows that Sen. Feinstein is a person who really likes to work both
sides of the aisle. She did a remarkable job.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she signed an early version of the censure resolution
but didn't support later, tougher versions.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman praised Feinstein for being ``very persistent and very
principled'' in her fight to bring a censure resolution to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Feinstein has sided with Clinton on many issues,
including the 1994 legislation that banned 19 types of assault
weapons, she became the first Senate Democrat to publicly scold
Clinton for lying about his relationship to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   A day after President Clinton addressed the nation Aug. 17 and
admitted an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky, Feinstein
shocked many of her supporters and colleagues by publicly
denouncing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trust in his credibility has been badly shattered,'' she
said. ``I was present in the Roosevelt room in January when the
president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica
Lewinsky. I believed him.'' She was referring to the now-famous
finger-wagging denial by the president that he had ever ``had
sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Lieberman, another influential Democrat made
a floor speech harshly condemning Clinton's conduct. That was
followed by an increasing chorus of Democrats who expressed their
disillusionment with Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has since rebuffed attempts by Clinton to discuss the
Lewinsky affair with her, although she has corresponded with him on
other matters, such as getting federal aid for citrus crops in
California's central valley that were damaged in December by a
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration responded by approving federal aid
for victims of that freeze disaster, including $1.7 million for
farm workers who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate vote to acquit Clinton, Feinstein scheduled a
news conference at 1:30 p.m. to discuss censure. But a bomb threat
caused Capitol police to order an emergency evacuation, forcing
Feinstein to cancel the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her future relations with the president, Feinstein
said the ball now is in his court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been through a year of trauma,'' Feinstein said.
``''He's been our leader _ he is our leader and we have to come to
terms with this... The president is speaking about reconciliation.
The president is the one who brought this on and reconciliation is
up to him.''
