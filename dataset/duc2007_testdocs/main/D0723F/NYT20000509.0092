   WASHINGTON _ Surrounded by organizers of Sunday's so-called
Million Mom March for tougher gun laws, Sen. Dianne Feinstein
introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain
semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you
want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun,
no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news
conference announcing her proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80
people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but
predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who
plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67
other cities against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and
semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips
would have up to 10 years to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of new guns would pay a $25 fee to a firearms dealer or a
state-certified entity to get licenses. Applicants would have to
provide their date and place of birth. They would also have to pass
a background check and a written firearm-safety test and sign a
pledge to keep weapons safely stored.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., the chief co-sponsor of the
measure, said the Senate ``does not have enough votes to pass
sensible gun control legislation'' because of the power of the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But he asked, ``What could be a better fight? A mother has to
know that her kids are safe. Why shouldn't we be able to get some
action in this place?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said gun control advocates
``cannot allow those people who are against what we're trying to do
to paralyze us, to freeze us in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said only one lobby can stand up to the NRA _ women.
She said the Million Mom March is just ``the beginning of an effort
to mobilize women.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said that ``for years we've been hearing from gun
owners who say they have rights.'' She added, `We have rights to
walk down the street and not get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases of Short Falls, N.J., founder of the Million
Mom March, said Feinstein's gun-licensing legislation is her top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put that on our agenda since day one,'' she said. The
organization also favors gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said she expects at least 150,000 mothers to
demonstrate in Washington, D.C. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including
large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn
out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to
find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control
measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in
different forms by both houses of Congress last year. The
legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more
than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure
that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the
backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers. The legislation would also
require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons
to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.
