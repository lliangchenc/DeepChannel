 CALIFORNIA SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN RESISTS TALK OF VEEP SPOT  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday
that the ``time is right'' for a woman to be on the Democratic
ticket _ but she bristled at the notion that she is the most likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't read into the future. I don't know what may happen or
may not happen,'' Feinstein told California reporters over
breakfast. ``I intend to be (a) United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauging Feinstein's chances of being the Democratic vice
presidential nominee is a popular _ though vexing _ pastime for
many Washington pundits. The former San Francisco mayor has long
been regarded an attractive running mate for whoever wins the
Democratic presidential nomination, and the speculation has
intensified in light of polls indicating that Vice President Al
Gore is struggling to maintain his advantage among women and
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein provides little guidance, showing little interest or
patience with the topic
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a coyness that has become a trademark during her
30-plus years in politics, Feinstein sipped orange juice and
brushed aside questions attempting to assess her interest,
acknowledging that such talk a year before the election ``makes me
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It builds up an expectation that I really don't see there,''
Feinstein said. ``I can't say what may happen. ... The probability
is very strong that I will be United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein told reporters that she is focused on the issues she
believes will form the core of her re-election bid: Improving
health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns,
eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together
opposing sides in California's long-running water wars.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is an overwhelming favorite to win re-election. The
only announced Republican challenger is Bill Horn, a member of the
San Diego County Board of Supervisors who is almost completely
unknown elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically she can run for both senator and vice
president at the same time, it would be awkward at best and could
threaten what now appears to be an easy re-election, several aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the indelicate matter of her age. The only reason
Feinstein would accept No. 2 is so she might someday be No. 1, her
loyalists say. Feinstein, who turned 66 last month, is not too old
for the post _ now. But if she were to serve two terms as vice
president, Feinstein would be 75 by the time she sought the
presidency _ older than Ronald Reagan when he ran for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was courted as a potential running mate by
Vice-President Walter Mondale in 1984, when she was mayor of San
Francisco. Her response to the initial inquiries then ring a
familiar tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am interested in being mayor,'' she said at the time, adding
that the vice presidency ``is not my interest. I do not intend to
pursue it. I intend to continue to run San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein ultimately sought the nomination with vigor, but was
passed over in favor of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The case for Feinstein as potential running mate is much
stronger than it was 15 years ago. In 1984 she was the mayor of a
Democratic city; now she represents a state with 54 electoral votes
_ 20 percent of the total needed to win the presidency. She comes
from the same ideological wing of the party as Vice-President Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, the only two Democratic presidential
candidates. She has established herself as a lawmaker who is tough
on crime, strong on public education, and is seen as a figure who
can rise above the partisanship that is so out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Hillary Clinton, Feinstein has emerged as
the nation's most recognizable Democratic woman at precisely the
time that the demand for female candidates appears to far outstrip
the supply. Of the party's six female senators and 39
representatives, none comes close to matching Feinstein in stature
or electability.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues with the political pressure on both parties to
place women on their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   `We've now established very strongly throughout this country
that women have taken a historically unprecedented role in
elections,'' Feinstein said. ``(They are) turing out in abundance,
(they are) creating the kind of critical mass in numbers that can
be very effective in electing officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation over Feinstein's candidacy may not reach a
crescendo for a little more than a year, when Democrats gather in
Los Angeles to formally nominate candidates for president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Feinstein is not only the leading female contender, but
for most pundits she is the top contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman with U.S. Senate and big city mayoral experience who
happens to be from the nation's largest state _ Wow! She's surely a
serious VP possibility with any presidential candidate,'' wrote Ron
Faucheux, editor and publisher of Campaigns &AMP; Elections Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's credentials look so good on paper that Parade
Magazine put her on the cover this spring as one of five women most
likely to become president by the year 2008. Washingtonian magazine
also names her the most likely VP nominee, calling a Gore-Feinstein
ticket ``the closest thing the party can find to a Hollywood Dream
Team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an image that some _ friends and foe _ dispute, and an
event late in the 1994 Senate campaign provides a telling example.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday night, and President Clinton was in San
Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, extolling Feinstein's virtues and
raising money for her re-election before a large crowd of wealthy
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was not there. She had remained in Washington to cast
a vote against Clinton's top legislative priority at the time _ the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have a No. 2 personality,'' said an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens,'' speculated another associate, ``when President
Gore wants to do one thing, and Vice President Feinstein wants to
do another?'' Of course, aides to former Sen. Lyndon Johnson
probably felt the same way in 1960.
