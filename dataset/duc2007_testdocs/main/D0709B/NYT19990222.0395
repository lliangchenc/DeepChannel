   When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after
winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all,
in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone
who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for
her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie. The white and silver racer-back
gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms. Jolie has to
offer that it seemed she had already been dipped in water.
</P>
<P>
   Awards shows like the Golden Globes, which took place last
month, have become a huge influence on fashion, previewing what
designers are likely to put on runways and stimulating sales. Ms.
Jolie's dress, by Randolph Duke, turned up in his show last Friday.
The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine
Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace
gowns he presented last week for fall. And the black and white
outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long
trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999
are a demure bunch. There was plenty of beauty worthy of the
Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance
for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit
heart palpitations. This design approach suited the moment well,
for with a few exceptions, it was a sexless season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that celibate fashion is bad. It's just different. Tommy
Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with
wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent
of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret. He gives
enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely
this side of Kmart oblivion. To the sounds of a live rock band,
Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection,
the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway
together.
</P>
<P>
   His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew,
especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white
stitching. The collection was further elevated by terrific fur
vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and
wool fit for a biker princess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of
creativity. There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her
inspirational mother lode. It was war. She masterfully rolled the
concept into her funky street-wear esthetic, with parachute nylon
jackets over slim pants, holey sweaters and shorts over trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective
utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats
or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
</P>
<P>
   That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising
given that Ms. Kerrigan hails from Ireland, where an awareness of
violence is never far from mind. Whether it was Ireland or the
millennium that drove her, the results were masterly.
</P>
<P>
   The pretty, festive clothes of the many designers who showed
evening wear in the last days of the shows, which ended Friday,
balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms. Kerrigan. In
his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short
excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded
chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla
frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt. Beaded
tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black
velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row
Hall was playing to. If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to
make an entrance, it lacked impact. If you were Dawn Mello, the
president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and
elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to
bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
</P>
<P>
   Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if
earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear. Ms. Wang offered
gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm
fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have
pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms. Wang handily paired
skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the
collection with a very American spirit. A wonderful impact of the
American shows' going first on the international calendar (London,
Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers
plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
Wang's show and at Duke's. It was uplifting to see Duke back on the
runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer. In
the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband,
Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _
off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing
them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all,
debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian
models was regrettable. Making race a part of an esthetic
unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be
left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of
the season, as has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of
view without typecasting. Fresh and original, Ms. Tam incorporated
futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly
dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual
icons embroidered onto T-shirts. Ms. Tam had her false starts, but
she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Ms. Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual,
turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection. Turbid colors
like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over
wide-leg trousers. Yohji Yamamoto makes this awkward asexual
proportion look easy. Ms. Feng shows us that, clearly, it is not.
