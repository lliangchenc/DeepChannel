   NY-WOJNAROWICZ (New York) _ David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a
near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people
who knew him, he still is. Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer,
he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the
1980's. But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.
He stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out,
and died there of AIDS at the age of 38. But at the moment he's
back in New York in full force. A retrospective titled ``Fever: The
Art of David Wojnarowicz'' has opened at the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo; several Manhattan galleries are showing
his work. A book of excerpts from his diaries has just appeared. By
Holland Cotter.

   BOOK-CLUBS (New York) _ Reading is an essentially solitary
activity, but talking about books requires at least two people.
Even if you live with another bibliovore, what are the chances that
you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss, say,
``Bleak House'' or ``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment? The
growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the
desire to talk about books as well as read them. By Bruce Shenitz.

   ELGAR (Undated) _ Americans march to Elgar at commencements as
they march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't
think about him most of the rest of the year. To a nation with
little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous
holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to
embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in
unstylish? staunchness and solemnity. But Elgar deserves respect
for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some
listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even
under the occasional bluster. And now, for no reason apparent in
the stars, a confluence of events has brought the composer to
attention. By James R. Oestreich.
