	   JAKARTA (JP): Die-hard fans of action and suspense movies can
currently get their eyeful at the city's cinemas. Below is a
synopsis of a few currently playing.
	   US Marshals. Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes and Robert
Downey Jr. Director: Stuart Baird.
	   Snipes has replaced Harrison Ford in the role of the fugitive
and this time, it is not a bus but a plane he escapes from.
	   Downey Jr. is an agent assigned by federal authorities to help
Gerard (Jones) catch the person who murdered his colleagues.
	   Desperate Measures. Cast: Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia.
Director: Barbet Schroeder.
	   In this thriller, Garcia is a widowed cop in San Francisco whose
son is dying of cancer.
	   The child's life could be saved with a marrow transplant.
	   The hitch?
	   The single match is a murderous sociopath (Keaton) who has spent
more than half his life in prison.
	   Keaton conveniently escapes from the operating room just before
surgery starts. Keaton goes loose in the hospital and Garcia gives
chase.
	   Playing God. Cast: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton and Angelina
Jolie. Director: Andy Wilson.
	   Eugene Sands (Duchovny), a surgeon who gets hooked on
amphetamines and loses a patient on the operating table, witnesses
a shooting at a disco and saves a man from death.
	   The man happens to be a friend of mobster Raymond Blossom
(Hutton) who decides to use Sands by getting him to play God.
	   Great Expectations. Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne
Bancroft, Robert De Niro. Director: Alfonso Cuaron.
	   The only ``different'' movie of the lot, it is a rags-to-riches
story telling of society's foolish pretensions.
	   Finn (Hawke), a poor orphan, has a horrifying encounter with an
escaped convict.
	   Years later, with complements of an anonymous benefactor, Finn
goes to New York and becomes an established artist.
	   He thinks his patron is loony recluse Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft),
and he dreams of winning her beautiful, icy ward, Estella
(Paltrow).
	   In Money Talk$, Chris Tucker as the scalper-turned-escaped-con
and Charlie Sheen, the TV broadcaster trying hard to save the day
are still driving audiences crazy with laughter and nonsense.
