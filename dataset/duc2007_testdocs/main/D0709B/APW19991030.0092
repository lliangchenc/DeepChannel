<HEADLINE> Director Didn't Want Jolie for Part </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The director and producer of the serial-killer  
thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit 
Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her  
Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was 
attending film school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce  
tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov. 5 edition. 
</P>
<P>
	It took some heated arguments -- with Noyce and producer Martin  
Bregman both fighting for Jolie -- and a serious slash to the film's 
budget to get Universal to agree, adds Bregman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown  
Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says. ``Angie's enormously  
gifted, and I usually get what I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and  
the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' 
who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel 
Washington.
