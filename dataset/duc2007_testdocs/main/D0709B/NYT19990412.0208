ANGELINA JOLIE IS `PUSHING' FOR STARDOM

 &HT;    Even the hottest young actress in Hollywood knows when it's time
to cool off.
 &HT;    After winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the
television movie ``Gia,'' Angelina Jolie pushed past the press
waiting outside, kicked off her heels and dove into the
Olympic-sized pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
 &HT;    Never mind her Randolph Duke dress with its 5,000
antique-crystal beads. Never mind her carefully coifed hairdo or
the Harry Winston baubles that surely weren't meant for moonlight
dips.
 &HT;    ``It surprised me that no one else jumped in the pool with me,''
the 23-year-old Jolie says. ``Here I am, at an event with the
wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and
serious. My question is, `Why wouldn't you want to jump into a
pool?'''
 &HT;    If you think that's unusual, try this: After her award-winning
turn in ``Gia,'' she actually contemplated quitting show business,
just as her agent's phone was starting to ring.
 &HT;    ``I was at a place in my life where I had everything I thought
you should have to make you happy,'' she recalls, ``and I felt
emptier than ever. I thought after `Gia' that I had given
everything I had to offer, and I didn't find myself growing.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have the strength to deal with Hollywood,'' she says
over breakfast at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, Calif. The lips
that have been described as being ``the size of sectional sofas''
curve in a frown.
 &HT;    ``I just needed to get away and find myself,'' she concludes.
 &HT;    Finding herself, in this case, meant going back to school for
some film classes.
 &HT;    ``It was at that point I realized how lucky I was to be on a
film set,'' she says. ``I suddenly appreciated my career, and I
started opening up again to Hollywood. I started to feel like the
fans I suddenly had weren't threatening to my life, but through my
work they were letting me in their life.''
 &HT;    A lot more people will be doing that after the April 23 release
of ``Pushing Tin,'' in which Jolie plays the knockout wife of a
macho, risk-taking air-traffic controller (Billy Bob Thornton).
Depressed, she winds up having an affair with another controller
(John Cusack), who happens to be her husband's main rival.
 &HT;    And, yes, going behind the scenes in the frenzied world of
air-traffic control made her a little nervous.
 &HT;    ``I had to keep reminding myself, `You're not going to die on a
plane. There is just no way,'' the actress says. ``In fact, I'm the
one who asks for the exit rows, because I want to be the one who
gets everyone out.
 &HT;    ``I'm not scared of much,'' she adds, ``because I really do live
by the creed that I might die tomorrow. In fact, I'm surprised I'm
still here. Honestly, I'm the kind of person who always could feel
the clock ticking.''
 &HT;    These are troubled times for Jolie, who is recently divorced
from ``Trainspotting'' star Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``We're great friends, and I love him to death,'' she says.
``We've been going through this breakup so slowly because we want
each other to have all that we need in life right now.''
 &HT;    Her voice lowers.
 &HT;    ``Right now we need to do things separately, but it's all done
from love,'' she says. ``We're both holding each other's hand
through this, and it's been amazing _ the divorce has actually
brought us closer. I still consider him my husband.''
 &HT;    The other man in her life is, of course, her father,
Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight. In fact, it was in one of his
movies _ ``Looking to Get Out'' (1982) _ that the 6-year-old Jolie
made her screen debut.
 &HT;    ``I don't have many memories,'' she says. ``I basically remember
being in a hotel room with my brother and dancing on the bed
because we were so bored.''
 &HT;    Jolie's mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, divorced her father
when she was an infant. Jolie lived with her, but spent weekends
with her father.
 &HT;    ``I would stage readings of plays in my living room,'' Voight
recalls in a separate interview. ``I remember, when Angie was 16,
she would stun us with powerful performances.''
 &HT;    Smitten, the young woman trained at the Lee Strasberg Theatre
Institute and then hit Hollywood. Early roles in ``Hackers'' (1995)
and ``Foxfire'' (1996) led to a role as the wife of the title
character in the cable movie ``George Wallace'' (1997). More
recently she was seen in ``Playing By Heart'' (1999), and she also
appeared in the Rolling Stones video, ``Has Anybody Seen My Baby?''
 &HT;    She shakes her head at the memory.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the Rolling Stones wanted,'' she says.
``Imagine my surprise when they wanted me to walk down the streets
in basically my underwear.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that it was New York,'' she adds, ``and no
one cared. People in restaurants were like, `Oh, there goes the
girl from ``Gia'' in her drawers.'''
 &HT;    Next up is ``The Bone Collector,'' in which she plays a cop
teamed with a paraplegic officer (Denzel Washington) in an effort
to solve a string of murders.
 &HT;    She's currently filming ``Girl Interrupted,'' set in a 1960s
women's mental institution and co-starring Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    ``I've actually spent the last week strapped to a bed, which ...
'' Jolie begins, then laughs. ``There is something so strange and
kinky to all this stuff. And awful _ I spent a week in solitary
with a straitjacket on, too.
 &HT;    ``I have to make light of this film, because it's pretty heavy
stuff,'' she says more seriously. ``It's set in the '60s, when
girls were sent to a mental hospital because they were gay. Women
got shock treatments and they didn't remember their family a week
later.''
 &HT;    As her three high-profile roles suggest, Jolie is in the process
of moving from the ``promising'' category to the ``star'' category.
It's a process that she admits she still can't quite comprehend.
 &HT;    ``It's so weird,'' she says. ``Let's take `The Bone Collector.'
I've seen the poster, which is me with a gun and a walkie-talkie.
In my mind, I look like I'm 5, playing dress-up.''
 &HT;    Less easy to accept is the media attention that comes with
stardom. She and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue
of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time. She flips
to the picture, and then scowls.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is hysterical,'' she says tightly, reading the
caption aloud with an edge to her voice. ```Angelina, a bad girl,
wears death tattoos and rubber clothes and likes to play with
knives. Some of this seems to have rubbed off on her old man.'''
 &HT;    Jolie fumes.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' she says grimly, ``I think I need to make some phone
calls when this interview is over.''
 &HT;    A few sips of orange juice later, she calms down.
 &HT;    ``I don't really take any of this stuff seriously,'' she says.
``I mean, how hot can I be? I'm really this goofy little odd
person, and someday the rest of the world will discover it. They'll
find out that the girl in those evening dresses is really a
complete idiot who spills coffee on herself and broke the phone by
falling over it this morning.
 &HT;    ``I'm one of the flawed people,'' she concludes. ``I just hide
it well.''
