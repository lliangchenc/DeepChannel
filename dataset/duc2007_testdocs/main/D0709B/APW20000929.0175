   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Sling Blade'' Oscar-winner Billy Bob
Thornton is recuperating at home after being treated at a hospital
for a viral infection.

   Thornton, 45, left a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, according
to publicist Michelle Bega, who denied reports that Thornton's ill
health was due to an eating disorder.

   The actor-writer-director said several years ago that he once
suffered from anorexia nervosa.

movie in England to be at his side, Bega said.

   ''He's doing wonderfully,'' Bega said, adding that Thornton
intends to join Bruce Willis in a couple of weeks to work on the
film ''Bandits.''
