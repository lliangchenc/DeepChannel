   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her
brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon,
Ange, give us a show!'' And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the
delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would
provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well. Nobody
ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking. Instead, as she was
growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings
and question the world around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to
other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be
really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial
about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've
also helped me live my life. Because, to me, to prepare to be a
good actor is to prepare to live life.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful
Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions. She
has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate
performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the
recent ``Playing by Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning
back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies
``Gia'' and ``George Wallace.'' In the former, she played a doomed
fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina
Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on
``Wallace.'' ``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and
divinely talented. She brings a hell of a lot to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's
upcoming trio of movies. In the current air-traffic controller
comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to
consuming vodka by the barrel. Arriving this fall is ``Girl
Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a
mental institution. Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her
schizophrenic friend.
</P>
<P>
   Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has
Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington. On that one,
Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her
young career.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily
admits as much. She did take a break once. Jolie had just finished
``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never
see the likes of it again. She was married, if just temporarily, to
actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers.'' And
she was achingly unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life
and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie
says. ``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life
for certain things. And I didn't know what more I had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jolie took a break. Sort of. She took writing and directing
classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized
_ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that
she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
</P>
<P>
   And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving. Jolie has
worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a
set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage. She's
constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve
as a person. It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find
the motivation to grow.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking
trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home,
absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives. Acting
was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the
signals were always there that she might give that to acting,''
says father Voight.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility. He
and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a
middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of
an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career. Jolie
doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with
Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because
they are so much alike.
</P>
<P>
   On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and
yet a bit mysterious. Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things''
she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken
understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
She reveals herself through her acting. And that's enough. That's
all she's willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says. ``I choose
roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because
that's the way I'm opening up. I make them real and I get close to
people. I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do
it, it's my life and it's not fake. It's not just a movie. It's a
real experience that I remember forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on
screen. There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty
rare, pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that
challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between. She
also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and
lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything. I'm
hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer
and be able to express it through my work. And if Hollywood doesn't
want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging,
then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive
to go through that transition because it's such an important one to
express. It's what life is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven,
tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;
