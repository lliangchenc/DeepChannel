   &UR; YOU BLINKED AND IT PASSED YOU BY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Movers and shakers and writers and editors at the Freedom
Forum's Newseum in Arlington, Va., have come up with a list of the
100 least significant news stories of the century. It should be
noted that most of them _ being easily forgettable _ are from the
last quarter of the 20th century. Personals' favorite 10:
</P>
<P>
   1) Millennium mania. 1999.

</P>
<P>
   4) Wiffle Ball. 1953.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT HARM CAN IT DO? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A female reader forwards a Wall Street Journal story about a
recent FDA report on possible side effects of Viagra:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abnormal hair growth, speech disorder, amnesia, loss of
libido, hallucination, anorexia, tinnitus, skin discoloration,
hiccups, sleepwalking, eye-rolling hostility, euphoric mood, dry
mouth, agitation, confusion, insomnia, abnormal thinking, abnormal
skin odor, depression, increased sweating, flatulence, abnormal
dreams and belching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Small price to pay!'' writes the sister.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In other accounts of masculine hardships, cosmetic
dermatologist  &UR; Seth Matarasso &LR;  told San Francisco magazine that
male lawyers are using Botox to paralyze facial muscles so that
their faces won't reveal their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A court in Germany ruled that &UR; Katarina Witt &LR;  is a public
figure and, therefore, a Frankfurt newspaper could legally reprint
a photograph of her ice skating nude. Witt had posed for the photo,
which appeared first in Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Norm Macdonald &LR; , interviewed just before his sitcom's debut,
in the latest Rolling Stone, said that he agreed to live in Los
Angeles only to be near his 6-year-old son (he is separated from
his wife).
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is all show-business people,'' said Macdonald.
``It's cool seeing celebrities from the old days, but there are
less and less of them. I only like guys that were famous before I
got into show business _ everyone else is, like, so what?''
</P>
<P>
   - The Sony Pictures film remake of ``Charlie's Angels'' will
star &UR; Drew Barrymore &LR; , &UR; Cameron Diaz  &LR; and  &UR; Angelina Jolie &LR; , says the
BBC. The grandes dames of the series _ &UR; Farrah Fawcett &LR; ,  &UR; Kate &LR; 
 &UR; Jackson &LR;  and  &UR; Jaclyn Smith &LR;  _ are said to have been asked to make
cameo appearances.
</P>
<P>
   - Was it an April Fool's joke, wonders  &UR; Jacki Bernier &LR; , that
that day's issue of the Berkeley Voice carried the banner notice:
``Daylight Savings: Don't forget to set clocks back an hour
Sunday''?
</P>
<P>
   - More than 25 years ago,  &UR; Jessica Mitford &LR; 's muckraking
magazine story about the Famous Writers School closed down that
institution. Now,  &UR; Bob Treuhaft &LR; , Mitford's widower, is pleased to
report that in February, a year after Vanity Fair posthumously
published her essay raking the funeral conglomerate Service Corp.
Inc., the value of that company's shares had dropped by two-thirds.
She would have wanted it that way.
</P>
<P>
   - Actress and literary critic  &UR; Christina Ricci &LR;  told Teen People
magazine that her favorite book is  &UR; Ayn Rand &LR; 's ``The
Fountainhead.'' ``It's really interesting how she romanticizes a
way of dealing with emotions and people that's so different than
what we're given in films and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Having your portrait painted is a strange experience. At the &LR; 
 &UR; same time, to anyone who has served in Washington, there is &LR; 
 &UR; something oddly familiar about it. First, you are painted into a &LR; 
 &UR; corner. Then you are hung out to dry. And finally, you are &LR; 
 &UR; framed.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Former Secretary of State  &UR; Warren Christopher &LR;  at the
unveiling of his portrait in the State Department last week.
