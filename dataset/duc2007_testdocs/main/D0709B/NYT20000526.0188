<P>
   Angelina Jolie lives on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Forget planning. Forget the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty
would dye her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you
seriously now. You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie
says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my
hair? Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, 25, delights in making waves. This is a woman who
literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a
Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a
large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor
Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's
``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was
just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Even her clothes are with that Jolie twist. She isn't wearing
DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Walmart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy
lips to burst into a smile. ``Hey, it was the only thing that was
clean. I don't have time to go to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, her career is in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' opening June 9. It's the story of two rival car thief
gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the
most merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the film because it was high art. It was my summer
vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,''
Jolie confesses.
</P>
<P>
   She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows
his wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't
get that out there,'' she says. ``We actually had a real thief on
the set escorted by his prison guard. I didn't know who they were
the first time. I thought they were two prop guys and then I got
the skinny. I asked the thief a million questions and this guy
could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget logic. Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector''
(1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl,
Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress. In fact,
that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big
screen version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,''
Jolie says. ``They told me there weren't many good characters for
strong women. But I countered that I've been able to play strong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a
big star,' which is frightening and not a plus in my book,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as a money job. Given the fact that I don't
really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to
me. I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds.' And
frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was
just so much cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress
Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her
newfound status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the same acting abilities. It's not like I'm
suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this box office
clout,'' she says. ``It's just that now I'm on more covers of
magazines. It's easier to hire me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie says.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky. I'm someone who
people took a chance on a few years ago when I was no one in this
town. And now? I don't think I'm so important. I'm just an actress
for hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that she has a poor self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as
an actress,'' Jolie says. ``I've done justice to my roles. I've
always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've
been offered. In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I
am the best person to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie felt that way about her Oscar winning role in ``Girl,
Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that movie. I got to fling the windows open and just
breathe and scream. It felt so good. I got to push buttons,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that she loves characters facing internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,''
Jolie says. ``For instance, when I'm intense, I might be crying but
a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying. You know, if I'm
soft I hate myself. I don't do self-pity. I want to scream, `I am
not weak!'''
</P>
<P>
   She mentions that being so tough isn't easy either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who need to learn to let somebody hug
me. I need to learn to need other people,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie shocked the world by marrying Thornton. Said Jolie
recently, ``I'm madly in love with this man and will be until the
day I die.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie, who's first husband was actor Jonny Lee Miller,
mentioned that marriage frightened her somewhat because of the
split of her own parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything is a possibility,'' Jolie said. ``I know I've
become more stable. I've become more centered. I feel like I've
grown up a lot in the last year.''
