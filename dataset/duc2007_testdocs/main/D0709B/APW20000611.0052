   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The car-heist caper ''Gone in 60 Seconds''
raced to the top of the weekend box office, debuting with $25.5
million and pushing ''Mission: Impossible 2'' back into the pack,
according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' overcame generally poor reviews that said
the action flick squandered the talents of Oscar-winning stars
Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. It was produced by
action master Jerry Bruckheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bad reviews don't matter,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office. ''People are
looking for escape in the summer. The movie's trailers promised
some fun, so audiences went out to theaters to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' likely will be gone from the top spot
next weekend, when Samuel L. Jackson's update of the 1970s
detective franchise ''Shaft'' debuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mission'' fell to No. 2 after two weekends in first place,
grossing $17.1 million to push its total to $157.9 million since
opening just before Memorial Day. It passed ''Gladiator,'' which
has taken in $150.2 million, as the top-grossing flick so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Momma's House'' was third in its second weekend, taking in
$16.8 million. The Martin Lawrence comedy had grossed $52 million
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   In its fourth weekend, ''Dinosaur'' took in $8.8 million and
increased its total gross to $110.5 million, making it the fourth
movie released this year to top $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two new movies did well in limited release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunshine,'' starring Ralph Fiennes in a saga that follows
three generations of a Hungarian-Jewish family, debuted with
$92,583 in seven theaters. The movie had a strong $13,226
per-cinema average, compared to $8,483 in 3,006 theaters for ''Gone
in 60 Seconds.'' ''Sunshine'' expands to more theaters in late
June.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespeare adaptation, a tuneful
version of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' updated as a 1930s Hollywood
musical, opened in two theaters with $27,000 for a $13,500 average.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
