Mining is destroying Aborigines' culture, representatives claim

	   JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government has mounted a
systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living
in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium
mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
	   The 27-member Aboriginal Mirrar clan strongly opposed the
building of the Jabiluka uranium mine on its traditional land, in
an area surrounded by Kakadu.
	   ``The Australian government has mounted a systematic and
sustained attack on the living tradition of the Mirrar and
Aboriginal people of Kakadu,'' Mirrar spokeswoman Jacqui Katona
told the U.N. delegation.
	   ``This attack on the political and social structures of
Aboriginal people has manifested itself in the form of massive
industrial development associated with uranium mining,'' Katona
said.
	   ``The Mirrar believe that the Australian government supports
mining at the expense of their very existence.''
	   She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
	   The team from the U.N. World Heritage Bureau is visiting the
park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values
of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine.
	   It will meet with mining company Energy Resources of Australia
Ltd. and government representatives later this week.
	   The team will report in December to a meeting of the bureau in
Kyoto, Japan, where it will recommend whether to place the park on
a list of endangered world heritage sites.
	   If Kakadu is put on the ``in danger'' list _ joining the likes
of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, the
war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African
state of Mali _ the value of the park as a tourist attraction would
be reduced, Katona said.
	   Such a decision would prove a major international embarrassment
to the government of Prime Minister John Howard, which has
maintained that the removal of 20 million metric tons of
radioactive uranium ore over 28 years will not harm Kakadu.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously
for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings,
rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
	   The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed
for both its environmental and cultural values. About 200,000
tourists visit the park every year.
