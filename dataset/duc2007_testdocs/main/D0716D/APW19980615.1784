Work begins on Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Construction of Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted
legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing
environmental protest.
	   A single bulldozer entered the Jabiluka mining lease in northern
Australia late Monday and began clearing the site ahead of actual
construction, miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said.
	   Chief executive Phillip Shirvington said construction of the
mine will take up to 18 months.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian
dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an
about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world
uranium market.
	   Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable
uranium reserves, but only about 14 percent of the world market
because of a previous government's restriction on the number of
uranium mines.
	   The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several
other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
	   Work began on site despite the company not having final approval
for its preferred plan for the project.
	   The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its
existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away,
for processing. The plan has been approved by government but is
opposed by key Aboriginal landowners, who don't want Jabiluka to
proceed.
	   A more expensive option is building processing facilities at
Jabiluka. ERA has a 1983 agreement signed by the landowners
approving this plan, but does not have environmental approvals from
the federal government.
	   Landowners have disputed the 1983 agreement and their attempts
to have the mining lease declared invalid have failed in the
courts.
	   Shirvington said Tuesday the contractor currently working on the
site agreed to work for ERA after protesters blockading the site
chained themselves to his truck as he was trying to reach a
different job.
	   ``He was pretty angry, we saw the opportunity and negotiated
with him to start working for us; he agreed and started straight
away,'' Shirvington said. ``The protesters delivered him right into
our hands.''
	   Kate Lecchi, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said they didn't
believe the contractor was not going to work on the Jabiluka site,
and that demonstrators will continue to try to stop construction.
	   ``We believe that because of our actions ERA is a year behind
schedule on this mine and we hope to delay them even more,'' she
said from the protest site, about 220 miles (350 kms) from Darwin.
