U.N. team investigates claims uranium mine threatens park

	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A high-level United Nations delegation
on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine
claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique
cultural and environmental values.
	   An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will
visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to
interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy
Resources of Australia Ltd..
	   The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan,
in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a
list of endangered world heritage sites.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. kms) of
pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-km)
sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many
that are rare or endangered.
	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously
for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings,
rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
	   The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed
for both its environmental and cultural values. Thousands of
tourists visit the park every year.
	   ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its
Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it
already operates inside the park. The company says its good
environmental record at the existing Ranger mine shows the Jabiluka
project poses no threat.
	   Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region
claim it will cause environmental damage.
	   U.N. team leader Prof. Francesco Francioni said its findings
will not be binding on the Australian government, even if the team
considers the park is under threat.
	   However, he said governments can be embarrassed into protecting
sites listed by the bureau as endangered.
	   ``The continuing value of Kakadu National Park is something that
concerns the whole world, the whole of humanity and therefore
justifies such interest,'' Francioni said.
	   Two parks are currently on the endangered list _ Yellowstone in
the United States and the Galapagos Islands.
