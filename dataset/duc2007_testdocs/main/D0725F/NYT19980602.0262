   WASHINGTON _ After India and Pakistan, what is next?
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration tried to stop the nuclear arms
race in south Asia, senior officials turned their attention Monday
to the next possible nuclear hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are
both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials,
although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several
years away from having devices that work. The arms buildup on the
Korean peninsula is less of a concern because North Korea, beset by
financial problems, has curtailed its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials in Washington admitted that events of the past
three weeks have shown that the United States cannot prevent the
rise of other nuclear states. A combination of threats and rewards
did not stop nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. And economic
sanctions will not sway Iran, which has no formal relations or
trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and other agencies disagreed
over the most pressing issue: how to prevent India and Pakistan
from turning nuclear devices into completed weapons that can be
delivered by missile.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the administration are calling for the strongest
sanctions possible, others argue that India and Pakistan need an
incentive to stop their tests and join the community of nations
committed to ending nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a loss over what to do,'' said an official familiar
with the discussion. ``We have to show them that there's another
avenue _ economic security instead of nuclear security.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been complicated by federal laws requiring
Clinton to impose rigid sanctions on countries that test nuclear
devices. The sanctions can be lifted only with the consent of both
houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there are some positive steps that India and Pakistan
can take to get out of the sanctions, there's no point in having
sanctions,'' said Tom Collina, a director of the Union of Concerned
Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Commerce Department argued Monday against
fully applying economic sanctions against Pakistan, which said it
conducted six nuclear tests last week. The officials warned that
the government in Islamabad would retaliate against American
companies that are engaged in multi-million-dollar energy projects
and other businesses in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pakistani members of Parliament also warned that
prolonged sanctions might force their government to reconsider its
allies. Ghul Sarwar Cheema, a retired Pakistani general who was
involved in Pakistan's clandestine nuclear program for more than a
decade, has suggested that Pakistan might share its nuclear
know-how with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, nobody is even thinking of doing that,'' he
said in an interview. ``But necessity is the mother of invention.
Don't force us, don't invite us, do not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials agree that both India and Pakistan should
immediately stop testing nuclear warheads, halt missile tests, end
the production of weapons-grade fuel, and join 149 other countries
in signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds quite logical. And that's the problem: Logic has
failed since India's tests rocked the western state of Rajasthan on
May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has articulated a series of steps that, if
taken, could cap the crisis right now and contain the damage,''
said Joseph Cirincione, a specialist on nuclear proliferation at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But, he added, ``I
am personally pessimistic about the ability of rational actors to
influence the process at this point. Passions are running hot and
heavy and there are many variables beyond anyone's control.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cut short a trip to Texas to return to Washington to
confer with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tomorrow
morning before she joins foreign ministers of the five permanent
United Nations Security Council members in Geneva to discuss the
arms race in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the non-profit Henry L. Stimson
Center, which studies arms control, said the turmoil in south Asia
has overshadowed significant achievements of the past 15 years in
halting the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the former Soviet Union have dismantled
thousands of nuclear warheads. South Africa, a former emerging
nuclear power, stopped its nuclear program before reaching weapon
capacity. In South America, Argentina, and Brazil pulled back from
the brink of a nuclear arms race. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan
have all agreed to rid their territories of nuclear warheads
deployed during the Soviet era. Iraq's nuclear weapons program has
been largely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Iran continues to raise the greatest concerns. In a 1994 speech
in Washington, James Woolsey, then director of central
intelligence, warned that Iran could become a nuclear state by the
year 2002 to 2004. That estimate has been pushed back slightly, but
Israeli intelligence services maintain that Iran might have a
nuclear device as soon as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which
opposes the regime in Tehran, said the government has been pursuing
a nuclear buildup known as the ``great secret plan.''
