Army chief: Israel must be ready for strike against Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The commander of Israel's armed forces said
Monday that Israel has to be ready for a pre-emptive strike against
Iran, should this become necessary.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz was commenting on last week's military
parade in Tehran in which Shahab-3 missiles capable of reaching
Israel were shown.
	   Mofaz told Israel that the missiles, together with the nuclear
warheads which Israel believes Iran is developing, pose ``a
long-term threat to Israel's survival.''
	   Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's
destruction.
	   Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh from the opposition Labor Party said
Sunday that Israel must consider a pre-emptive strike against Iran,
using conventional weapons.
	   Other lawmakers criticized Sneh's statement as irresponsible.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no call for such
declarations.
	   However, Mofaz said Monday that the concept of a pre-emptive
strike against an imminent threat is ``part of the world view'' of
the Israeli armed forces.
	   ``I think ... a pre-emptive strike is something the armed forces
should be ready for, and if it is needed they must be capable of
carrying it out,'' he said.
	   At the start of the 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli air force
destroyed most of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces in
a pre-emptive strike.
	   In 1981, Israeli fighter bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor in
Iraq shortly before it was to become operational. Israel believed
the reactor would be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
	   Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage, will be ready. He said Iran is developing
atomic weapons at the same fast rate.
	   Mofaz did not say how a pre-emptive strike against Iran would be
carried out. The Israeli air force recently took delivery of a new
version of the American F-15 warplane which is capable of reaching
Iran.
