<P>
   People in Israel are getting fairly perplexing bits of news
about missile proliferation in their region.
</P>
<P>
   These usually come from the American government rather than
their own. The biggest shock came in July, when the American
Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket
called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could
put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news
that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel
with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a
computer-simulated target.
</P>
<P>
   For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical
challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's
success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments. A
separate, all-American effort to develop an anti-missile shield for
overseas troops and bases -- known as THAAD -- has been dogged by
technical failures.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Arrow's most enthusiastic advocates acknowledge
that it will not provide Israel with an impenetrable shield. And
its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli
strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist,
reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of
$1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says
is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the
missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty
shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear
challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal -- and its
willingness to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and
Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further
forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has
championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the
Shahab-3 may already be operational. The previous, cozy assumption
of defense experts that some time must elapse between testing and
deployment no longer holds good.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon also believes that as early as next year, Iran will be
able to test (and presumably soon deploy) another system, the
Shahab-4, with a 2,000-kilometer range that runs deep into Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even for Israelis, the most troubling recent development in
missile proliferation was the news on Aug. 31 that North Korea had
launched a three-stage missile, known as the Taepo Dong, which is
apparently capable of reaching the western fringes of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   On past experience, whatever rocket technology appears in North
Korea will then spread rapidly to Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no simple correlation between the range of
a country's rockets and the fear it arouses. For instance, the West
is not particularly alarmed, at least for the moment, by the fact
that Saudi Arabia has rockets that can go farther than any other in
the region. Saudi Arabia's missiles were quietly obtained, during
the 1980s, from China -- which, ironically, may have bought the
technology from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The states whose arsenals keep western and Israeli security
people awake at night are Iran and Iraq. Although Iraq is banned
under UN sanctions from deploying systems with a range of over 150
kilometers, it may have secretly saved a few of its old rockets
from destruction -- and might be able to rebuild a medium-range
missile capacity fairly rapidly once sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying vigorously to stem the flow of Russian technology
to Iran, Israel appears to have accepted that nothing is likely to
stop the Shahab series of missiles from being developed.
</P>
<P>
   But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself
could be in Iran's sights. ``The threat is not only to us, but to
many others in the region,'' said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's
prime minister, on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   He might have added that Israel is probably not even
particularly high on Iran's list of concerns. Iran has been
impelled into missile-building by memories of its weakness during
its war with Iraq in the 1980s, when it was unable to retaliate in
kind to the Iraqi missiles that caused panic, and thousands of
civilian deaths, among its urban population.
</P>
<P>
   Its immediate enemy is the Taliban in Afghanistan who have
threatened -- albeit not all that seriously -- to deploy their Scud
missiles against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Iran's defense minister, Adm. Ali Shamkhani, is
relishing the consternation that the missile test has caused. ``God
willing, this will not be the only time that dedicated and
mobilized workers of our defense industry surprise Israel's defense
machinery,'' he gloated.
