reaffirmed its opposition Monday to Russian participation in the

"We are opposed to any form of nuclear cooperation with Tehran,
given its demonstrated interest acquiring a nuclear weapons
capability," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.

Last week, Russia confirmed its intention to complete work on
the Bushehr nuclear power project and strongly denied U.S.
allegations the plant could help Tehran build an atomic bomb.

produce nuclear weapons.

projects that could be the most dangerous in terms of nuclear
proliferation.
