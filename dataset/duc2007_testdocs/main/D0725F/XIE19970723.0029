TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi

supports the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and elimination of the

Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

transparent and for humanitarian purposes. We always welcome
sharing experience with respective international agencies."

Blix appreciated the current cooperation between Iran and the
IAEA, saying Iran allows the agency to inspect any nuclear center
in Iran at any time.

He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation
conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability
is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes.

biased for political ends.

"It is the natural right of any nation to acquire nuclear
technology for the production of electricity, the manufacture of

protection of the environment," he was quoted by the official news

rivals. Both Washington and Tel Aviv maintain that Iran is seeking
to use nuclear technology for military purposes.

The U.S. and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive
air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port
city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic
bomb.

Iran is finishing the power plant with help from Russia.
Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv
to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will
be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf.
