<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Buying Chemical Weapons from Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday dismissed as
"baseless" the Israeli claim that it had bought chemical weapons
parts and technologies from an Israeli arms trader.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
such baseless claims by Israeli officials indicated Israeli
uneasiness over Iran's diplomatic efforts made at the international
arena to curb the danger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the comments after an Israeli court convicted
Wednesday Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, of illegally
selling biological and chemical weapons parts and knowhow to Iran
for 16 millions U.S. dollars in the past years. Manbar is expected
to be sentenced to life sentence on this charge.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused high-ranking Israeli officials of
spreading false rumors against Iran, saying Tehran is seriously
trying to cleanse the Middle East from nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Israeli accusation coincided with Iran's
successful efforts to pressure Israel on the nuclear issue. He
added that Iran believes security would be restored in the Middle
East region through controlling and curbing Israel's atomic
efforts. He stressed that Israel can not legitimize its
occupation even through its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi finally urged the International Atomic Energy Agency
to conduct inspection of Israel's nuclear facilities. Israel is
believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired
nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
Although western intelligence reports claimed that Israel has
about 200 nuclear warheads, Israel has neither denied nor
confirmed that it has nuclear weapons. Worried that its leading
enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its
safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the
world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed
to build a nuclear bomb.
