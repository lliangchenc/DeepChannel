<HEADLINE> Iran: Navy Game With India Has No Nuclear Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of Iranian Naval Forces
Abbas Mohtaj said on Sunday that the forthcoming joint Iran-India
naval game has nothing to do with Iran's stand towards nuclear
tests carried out by India and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj confirmed that two Indian vessels have arrived at
Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf to join a week-long
drill with Iranian navy due to start on June 9, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that the exercises are very elementary and of no
operational significance because of the low number of vessels due
to participate.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and
transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and
Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban
treaty and believes that any action by any country to carry out
nuclear test is provocative.
</P>
<P>
Iran has good relations with both Islamabad and New Delhi on
diplomatic and defensive grounds, he added.
</P>
<P>
India donated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13,
threatening to spark a round of nuclear arms race in the
subcontinent. Pakistan, under great domestic pressure, conducted
two rounds of nuclear tests in response two weeks later.
