<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Urge Nuclear-Free Zone in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia Friday urge all
countries concerned to take "practical and urgent measures" to
establish a zone free of nuclear arms in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued in a joint communique released here after
two day talks between Iran and Russia on nuclear weapons,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the
proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction constituted threat to international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
It said that the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free
zones, particularly in the Middle East, should be encouraged as a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
The two sides demand the U.N. and other international
organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), play a vital role in creating such zones.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East
region would considerably strengthen peace and security both at
both regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the
Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to
the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough
restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
The communique called for the earliest possible accession to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of all states that
have not signed it, particularly the countries in possession of
nuclear facilities not subject to the IAEA safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right
of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful
purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states
under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.
</P>
<P>
Russia expressed satisfaction with Iran's declaration that it
was committed to the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons and had no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique was apparently aimed at allying the fear
among some countries, including the U.S. and Israel, that Iran is
striving to acquire nuclear weapons and long-range missiles with
the Russian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli pressure, the U.S. Congress is considering to
impose sanctions against Russian companies reportedly involved in
transferring nuclear and missile technologies to Iran.
