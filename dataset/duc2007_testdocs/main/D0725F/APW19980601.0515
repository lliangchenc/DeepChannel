Iran says it won't build nuclear bomb

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite
nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new
security situation'' on the country, the defense minister said in
comments published Monday.
	   ``Just as the whole international and regional order has been
affected by the present situation, Iran too has been placed in a
new security situation,'' Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani said in an
interview with Tehran's Jameah daily.
	   ``Iran must take a new look at its security and strategic
situations, but this does not mean entry into the age of nuclear
(weapons) activity,'' Shamkhani was quoted as saying.
	   India tested five nuclear devices last month, which were
followed by six explosions by arch-rival Pakistan.
	   But the tests do not put Iran under pressure to start its own
nuclear weapons program, Shamkhani said. ``The present arena
concerns only India and Pakistan,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Iran denies repeated U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is
close to building an atom bomb, saying its nuclear program is
peaceful.
	   Just before he was toppled by Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution,
the U.S.-backed shah launched an ambitious nuclear program which he
said was meant to guarantee future energy needs.
	   The program was abandoned after the revolution, but restarted in
1988. So far, Iran is only known to have several small nuclear
research facilities.
	   Russia is currently building a dlrs 800 million nuclear reactor
in southern Iran despite opposition by the United States, which
says the facility could provide Tehran with the means to build a
bomb.
	   Iran has good military ties with China, which is believed to
have helped Pakistan build its bombs.
