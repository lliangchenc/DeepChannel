	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare interview to an Israeli TV station,
Pakistan's minister of information said Friday that his country was
not cooperating with Iran on nuclear technology.
	   Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned
of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing
by Pakistan and India.
	   ``Pakistan has no cooperation with any other country on the
nuclear issue or the missile issue,'' Mushahid Hussein said in an
interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Muslim country to go nuclear.
	   Channel 2 however said that despite a lack of diplomatic
relations, Pakistan was open to the station's request for an
interview which was conducted with the help of a Pakistani
broadcast company.
	   Hussein tried to calm concerns in Israel that Pakistan might
share its capabilities and technology with other Muslim states.
	   ``It is the view of Pakistan that bombs do not have religions it
is unfair, unjust and wrong to qualify Pakistan's nuclear program
in religious terms,'' he said.
	   He said that Pakistan did not know the status of Iran's nuclear
program.``We have no idea about other countries' nuclear programs.
We have no idea what other countries in the region are doing, not
Iran, Iraq or Israel,'' he said.
	   He said the recent visit of Iran's foreign minister to Pakistan
following the tests had been scheduled in advance.
	   ``We hope that no other country would feel threatened by
Pakistan's nuclear program,'' he said.
	   Asked to comment on reports in Israel earlier this week that
Pakistan had feared an Israeli air strike hours before going ahead
with its nuclear tests. Hussein replied:``We are not saying that.
There have been reports in the Western press and Indian press on
that count but this is not Pakistan's official position.''
