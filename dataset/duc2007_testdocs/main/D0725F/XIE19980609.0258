<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Charges on Nuclear Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran has dismissed as a "baseless
claim by the Zionist (Israeli) circles" the allegation that Iran
had asked Pakistan to transfer its nuclear technology, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi in New York Monday
said that Iran basically does not need such programs and has urged
India and Pakistan not to involve themselves in nuclear test
races.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi's remarks came after Israel called the nuclear
devices detonated by the Pakistanis late last month in response to
India's nuclear tests as "Islamic bombs."
</P>
<P>
Iran, among the Islamic countries, has hailed the Pakistani
nuclear explosions as Islamic world's deterrent Israel. The tests
in south Asia triggered serious concern about the proliferation of
nuclear technology in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against
Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever
growing stock of nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Israeli move was designed to
procrastinate supervision by the International Atomic Energy
Agency of its nuclear installations and the signing of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that the strengthening of the NPT without any
discrimination to include nuclear powers and Israel, is the best
way to guarantee global peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly stressed the need to eventually make South
Asia and the Middle East nuclear-free.
