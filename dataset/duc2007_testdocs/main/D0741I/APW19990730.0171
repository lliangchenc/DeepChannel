<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Gunman Kills 12 People, Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Authorities are grimly piecing together what they  
know about Mark O. Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and 
former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and 
killed nine people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the  
shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself 
Thursday evening as police closed in. Authorities later said he had 
killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst 
workplace massacres in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their  
frantic attempts to avoid the killer. Seven remained in critical 
condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were  
open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, 
yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card 
that said, ``I'm so sorry. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance  
Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a 
break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said  
Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. 
``Unfortunately true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day  
trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in 
the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday. But Barton's 
family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he 
hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what caused Mr. Barton to begin shooting,''  
Mayor Bill Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.  
Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they 
had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least 
three more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little  
more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 
3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the 
latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, 
and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when  
he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two 
Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of 
Atlanta about 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32,  
who works on the building's third floor. ``There was a trail of 
blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.'' It wasn't 
immediately clear what relationship Barson had with the Momentum 
firm, if any. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the  
All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont 
Center building where he had been a client. Five died there. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point  
reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton came into the office ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager, suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, 
said in a statement released from the company's headquarters in 
Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting  
at her computer when she heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the  
first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. ``He 
was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The 
bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I 
was able to escape,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the victims were shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber  
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next five hours, the mayor and police did not know where  
Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look 
for him. Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the 
doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded  
ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51. ``We had no idea what was 
going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About five hours after the shootings, Barton showed up at Town  
Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, where he approached a 
woman in the parking lot, said Cobb County police spokesman Dana 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to run away and contact security,'' he said  
today. ``What his intentions were with her is a still part of the 
investigation.'' He wasn't sure if she recognized him from news 
reports or was afraid because of something he had said or done. She 
contacted mall security, and around the same time, someone else 
also spotted Barton's dark green minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were alerted and began chasing Barton up Interstate 75.  
The chase ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at 
a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and 
roughly five miles from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Barton's 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, and  
children, 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, 
were found in their home in Stockbridge, 16 miles southeast of 
Atlanta. Police said they had been bludgeoned to death perhaps as 
long as two days before the office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's bodies were in their beds, with sheets pulled up  
to their necks and towels around their heads so only their faces 
showed, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County. Mrs. 
Barton's body was in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	A handwritten note was left on each body and a  
computer-generated note left in the living room explained ``why he 
did what he did,'' Mercer said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain  
this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. The current prosecutor declined to say whether Barton was 
still a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is still reeling from earlier shootings, including a  
domestic dispute July 12 that left seven people dead. In May, a 
15-year-old student shot six students in nearby Conyers, none 
fatally.
