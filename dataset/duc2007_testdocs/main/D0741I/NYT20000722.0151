   ATLANTA _ A widow kept old sheets on the bed because they
smelled like her husband.
</P>
<P>
   A former stock trader even fears going to the bank, worried that
someone will shoot him again.
</P>
<P>
   A grandfather can't bear to visit the graves of his
granddaughter and grandson, who flank his slain wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, they faced unimaginable violence; today, and
perhaps forever, unfathomable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Mark Barton.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day
trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial
district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history. During
the previous two days, he had bludgeoned his wife and his two
children. Later, as police surrounded his green minivan, Barton
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, 13 people were dead. Another 13 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, most of the survivors' physical injuries have
healed. The day-trading offices _ Momentum Securities Inc. and
All-Tech Investment Group _ have reopened; fresh paint, wallpaper
and carpet cover the remnants of the carnage. Families of some
victims have moved into new homes, trying to escape the memories.
Lawsuits have been filed, relationships have frayed, counseling and
antidepressants have failed to eliminate the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I pray and read my Bible, Kevin's kind of talking
to me,'' Buddy Dial, a former All-Pro football player, said of his
slain son. ``It's been very difficult, losing Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do all the things we used to do together _ jogging and
playing tennis _ but now I do it without my partner,'' said Roy
Webb, whose son, Scott, was killed. ``I guess that feeling will
never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who lived through the day's horror, directly or indirectly,
say they've accepted what happened, and even gotten over their
anger. Some won't talk about it at all, and others say they've
simply tried to put the event out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole stance is, it's still in the past,'' said Scott
Manspeaker, back to work as a manager at All-Tech after nearly
bleeding to death from two gunshot wounds. ``We're over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't bring it up,'' said Ginger Lewis, a cousin of
Barton's slain wife, Leigh Ann. ``I can be driving down the road
and I get a little flash of it and I feel like I'm going to cry,
but I tuck it away. That's what I do with bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others have analyzed and reanalyzed everything that
happened. They've tried to reconstruct every moment of the tragedy,
endlessly seeking some truth that will help it all make sense. What
they find, though, are others asking the same question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week I or somebody I know runs into somebody who was
touched by that incident,'' said Nell Jones, who eluded a bullet
from Barton but witnessed his rampage at All-Tech. ``It's
absolutely mind-boggling that one person could create that much
sorrow. One person.''
</P>
<P>
   `GOD TOOK AN ANGEL'
</P>
<P>
   Marie Quinn wonders about Barton. Why didn't he just kill
himself that day in Atlanta? Why did he have to take so many with
him? And why her husband, Edward?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much anger in me, it's unbelievable,'' Quinn said
recently in the large brick house she and her husband built 14
years ago. ``Even though I go to counseling, I don't think I'll
ever be able to let it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nights are the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have trouble going to bed, because I know Eddie won't
be there,'' she said. ``After he was killed, I waited a long, long
time to change the sheets because they smelled like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her salvation, she said, has been her first grandson, Bryce. He
was born three months before her husband was killed, and the family
treasures its photographs of grandfather and grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``God took an angel,'' she said, ``and, at the same time, gave
us an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who became widows last July 29, Roya Havash has
suffered from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Medication has helped, she said, but it hasn't lessened her
feeling that her husband, Jamshid, wasn't supposed to be at
All-Tech that day.
</P>
<P>
   In her husband's personal effects she found a ticket from the
toll booth on Ga. 400 near the shooting scene. He had passed
through just 45 minutes before he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe in destiny,'' she said. ``We're Muslim. The Quran
said that when your time comes, you have to go. There's nothing you
can do about it. . . . In a way, I think it was his time. But it
was too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulshan Harjee thinks of what her husband, Dean Delawalla, has
missed the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Faisal, turned 16 and learned to drive. Soon he'll
start visiting colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Shahla, turns 5 on Friday. Her birthday will
always fall the day before the anniversary of her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing we'll live with every year,'' Harjee
said. ``We need to reclaim the sadness of that day . . . because
the children have to have their lives and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Tenenbaum's three children have given her strength to deal
with the loss of her husband, Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But as they grow, she said, she realizes how much time has
passed without her husband.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, her 4-year-old son, Scott, jumped up from
the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to look at a picture of Dad _ I almost forgot what
he looked like,'' he told his mother.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Kathleen Van Camp ever saw was Barton's face.
</P>
<P>
   She was sitting in an office at All-Tech when Barton came in,
pulled out two handguns and began firing. He shot her twice _ once
in the chest, once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, her world went dark.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, Van Camp said, she has undergone ``many
surgeries,'' and she expects more.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not expect to regain her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm weary,'' she said. ``I guess I'm getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes classes at the Center for the Visually Impaired. She
visits friends, dines out occasionally, follows the stock market,
goes to doctors' appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much it,'' she said. ``I don't really want to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the shooting, Van Camp enjoyed her independence. Now she
relies on her husband of 13 years, Michael Sovereign, and others to
take her everywhere. That loss of freedom, she said, has been the
hardest adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a really self-reliant person,'' she said, ``and suddenly
I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence of former day trader Sang Yoon's wound is a
scar along his lower left forearm. But he, too, has lost his
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes deposits from his dry cleaning business to the
bank, he said, he fears someone will shoot him for his money. In a
crowd _ a restaurant, a ballgame _ he is afraid a shooting will
erupt.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent power outage at his business, when he heard
sounds from an electric pole, he thought they were shots. He took
the rest of the day off.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he said, his temper is short.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says I've changed,'' he said. ``When my baby is
crying, I used to take care of that. But now I get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he feels a tickling sensation along his scar.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to his heart, he said, ``I'm still uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Helen Brown counted on her son, Russell. When her husband and
oldest son had cancer, it was Russell who nursed them. And when
something needed repairing at her home in Florida, it was Russell
who took care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russell was killed at Momentum, Brown has sold her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I looked, I saw Russ,'' said Brown, who now lives
near her daughter in Orlando. ``He was the project guy. He came
down every other month to fix things around here for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She never wants to visit Atlanta again, not even for a memorial
service July 30 for Barton's victims. Not even to see her son's
fiancee of eight years, Patti Balon.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown family has broken its ties with Balon after a
disagreement over how to disperse Russell's ashes. The family
insisted that she send them everything of Russell's _ his clothes,
furniture, ashes. Balon and the Brown family no longer speak to one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Balon described the estrangement as unfortunate. She said she's
still grieving, but is working 70-hour weeks as a diversion. ``I
put it on the back burner and don't think about it unless it hits
me right in the face,'' Balon said. ``I am so full of anger
still.''
</P>
<P>
   AN OFFICER ALSO GRIEVES
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, Rene Swanson thinks about what she discovered
at Barton's apartment in Stockbridge. Still, her voice breaks when
she talks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to describe it,'' said Swanson, a detective
with Henry County police. ``When I went in there, it was the worst
thing I would ever want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton's children,
11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Michelle, and their stepmother,
Leigh Ann Barton. All three had been beaten to death with a hammer.
Barton admitted to the crimes in a suicide note he left in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said she can't come to terms with the ritualistic way
Barton killed his children, then washed and combed their hair,
dressed them in pajamas, tucked them into bed and surrounded them
with their prized possessions. Beside Matthew he placed a Swiss
army knife, Boy Scout patches and Pokemon trading cards; beside
Michelle, a doll with a pink dress and blond hair in pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could smell shampoo in their hair,'' Swanson said. ``In
some sense, there had to be some kind of love there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting through her emotions was made easier by a friendship
forged out of the case _ with Bill Spivey, the children's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey believes his wife, Eloise, and Debra, his daughter and
Barton's first wife, were murdered by Barton in 1993, a case which
remains unsolved. Spivey invited Swanson to lunch a few weeks after
last year's killings. This month, he asked Swanson, her husband and
their children to join his family for a Fourth of July party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' said Swanson, who normally doesn't
socialize with people she meets on her job. ``Michelle and Matthew
_ if things were different, it would have been them playing in the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey doesn't like to talk about the killings. And he avoids
the cemetery where his grandchildren, their mother and his wife are
buried alongside one another. Visiting the grave sites, he said, is
too painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have lost our loved ones,'' Spivey said. ``If we can
put this behind us and go on and try to have a constructive life,
we would all be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING PEACE
</P>
<P>
   Alyce Wenzel has tried to move on. But sometimes, just driving
the car on an errand, she bursts into tears, remembering her son,
Scott Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie never had a chance to get married or have children,
and he loved children,'' Wenzel said. ``I'll just have to learn to
take it day by day. God doesn't give you more than you can handle.
I believe that, or there isn't anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nell Jones has tried to put the shootings behind her, too. She
returned to day trading for a while, but only as a form of therapy.
Being around others who had lived through the killings helped her
regain control of her emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, she mostly stays at home, close to her family,
seeking clarity about life _ trying, she said, to filter out the
``background noise.''
</P>
<P>
   She is haunted by visions of what she witnessed: ``These lovely,
innocent people . . . murdered in cold blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were there, and they were gone,'' she said. ``If I had
been killed, what would I have left behind? What would I have left
undone and unsaid? And can I look around and do them now?''
</P>
<P>
   One victim especially occupies her thoughts: Vadewattee
Muralidhara, over whose body she stepped when she emerged from a
closet where she hid during part of Barton's shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
   Muralidhara's husband is haunted, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not keen on day trading,'' Kesturkoppal Muralidhara
said. ``It was I who was interested. I forced her.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently moved to a new house, hoping to leave behind happy
memories that now seem so painful. But his wife's clothes hang in
his new closet.
</P>
<P>
   When he closes his eyes, he sees his wife in the dress she wore
when she died. He sees her gazing at him from the passenger side of
his car, undressing by the bed they shared for 22 years, cooking
the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children come home and sit around,'' he said. `` `Daddy,
where is the food?' `Look,' I say, `I cannot cook. Let's go out and
eat.' They want to sit down at a table and all eat together. We
have not done that in almost a year now. Not one time. That
happiness, I don't think, will ever come back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the Muralidhara family traveled to their native
Trinidad for a Hindu ceremony. Thirty days before the anniversary
of a death, Hindus believe, the soul ascends to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   So 11 months after Barton killed her with a bullet to the head,
Vadewattee Muralidhara's ashes were scattered in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her husband said, this would bring ``peace to her
soul.''
