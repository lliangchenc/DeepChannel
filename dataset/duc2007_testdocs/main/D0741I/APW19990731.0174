<HEADLINE> Barton's Wife Had Safety Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mass killer Mark O. Barton's first victim in a  
murderous rampage last week -- his wife, Leigh Ann -- had been 
worried for her safety but loved Barton's children and wanted to 
continue to be involved in their lives, her sister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry it happened to my sister but I'm not surprised,''  
said Dana Reeves, Leigh Ann Barton's older sister. ``I've felt that 
this has been coming for a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Barton killed his 27-year-old wife with a hammer Tuesday,  
it was the beginning of the bloodiest mass killing in Atlanta's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The next night he killed his two children from a previous  
marriage as they slept in the family's suburban apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings were discovered Thursday when Barton, a chemist  
turned day stock-trader, walked into the offices of two brokerage 
firms and fired randomly at traders and employees. Nine died and 13 
were wounded, with four still in critical condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Barton killed himself as police pulled over his  
van. 
</P>
<P>
	The first funeral was Friday for Allen Charles Tenenbaum, a  
48-year-old father of three. The grocer was gunned down while 
trading at All-Tech Investment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Mohammed Delawalla, 52, of Atlanta was buried Saturday  
after a one-hour, 15-minute Islamic service at a funeral home in 
suburban Lilburn. A spokeswoman for the family, Zeenat Hussain, 
estimated that 2,000 attended the service, much of which took place 
on the asphalt parking lot with the media looking on from a nearby 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dean was a very devoted member of this community,'' Ms.  
Hussain said. 
</P>
<P>
	A private memorial service was held in Buckhead for family  
members of the victims. Afterwards, relatives of one of the dead, 
Edward Quinn, walked solemnly down Piedmont Road to the building 
where he was killed. There, they said prayers and placed flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Services for Mrs. Barton were scheduled for Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves, who lives in Macon, said her sister left Barton in  
October, in part because she was frustrated after supporting her 
jobless husband for about a year. She worked as a sales 
representative for a company that sells cleaning supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said she was wary of Barton after learning that his  
first wife and her mother had been hacked to death in Alabama in 
1993. Barton was the prime suspect in the slayings, but police said 
they never had enough evidence to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never really a comfortable feeling with him after  
that,'' Ms. Reeves said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver at the  
time of the Alabama slayings. If Barton killed his first wife, Ms. 
Reeves said, her sister knew nothing of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just an innocent victim that something terrible has  
happened to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Mrs. Barton's body covered with a blanket in a  
bedroom closet of the apartment. In a computer-printed suicide note 
Barton left for police, he said he was sorry for his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others,'' Barton wrote. ``I 
really wish I hadn't killed her now. She really couldn't help it 
and I love her so much anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said her sister would talk of fights with Barton, but  
would never answer directly when asked if he abused her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she had fears from him,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last deep-down, heart-to-heart conversation we had, I  
asked her was she comfortable or scared. She said, `Yes, but my 
apartment has this security system and that makes me feel 
comfortable.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in October but Mrs. Barton allowed her  
husband to move into her apartment a few weeks ago, her sister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said she thinks her sister tried to reconcile with  
Barton because she missed his children -- Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 
7. She said Mrs. Barton treated the children as if they were her 
own, coaching Matthew's soccer team and leading Mychelle's Brownie 
troop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she had some concerns about the kids, wanting to be  
with them and wanting to be involved in their life like she had 
been,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten shooting victims remained hospitalized after one woman was  
discharged Saturday from Grady Memorial Hospital. Four were in 
critical condition, including a 38-year-old woman shot in the 
temple and who may be blinded permanently.
