<HEADLINE> Neighbors Describe Gunman as Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark Barton, the 44-year-old day trader at the center of  
Thursday's bloody rampage, was described by neighbors in the 
Atlanta suburb of Morrow as a quiet, churchgoing man who worked all 
day on his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who had split up with his wife earlier this year, had  
been living with his two children from a previous marriage in the 
southern suburb. The three of them moved out over the July 4th 
weekend, and the children told neighbors they were moving to nearby 
Stockbridge to live with their stepmother, identified by a neighbor 
as Lee Ann Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Mrs. Barton and the children were found in Mrs.  
Barton's apartment after Barton went on the rampage at two 
brokerage offices, killing nine people. Barton later committed 
suicide when police closed in on him in his dark green van at a gas 
station in northern Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located, said  
handwritten notes left on the bodies indicated that Mrs. Barton may 
have been killed Tuesday and the children on Wednesday. The 
children were in their beds and his wife was in a closet. Police 
said a typed note was found in the living room explaining his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had lived in Morrow for about a year, renting a neatly  
kept, two-story house in a modestly priced residential 
neighborhood, said Christine Johnson, 58, who lived two doors away. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a chemist, seldom left his house and was always at work  
on his computer, Mrs. Johnson said. When he did leave the house, it 
was to walk around the neighborhood for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept to himself,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``If he drove by in  
his van he threw his hand up. But that was about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another acquaintance in Morrow, Marsha Jean DeFreese, said  
Barton went to church and was a Scout master of her grandson's 
troop. She said he took them out every Tuesday. ``He looked odd to 
me,'' she said. ``I thought something's weird about this man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the children, Michelle and Matthew, were ages 7 and  
12 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Northcutt, 38, who lived on the same street as Barton in  
Morrow, said Barton ``always seemed preoccupied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had other things on his mind,'' she said. ``He didn't seem  
friendly at all. He was making an effort to have something to do 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors in Morrow said Mrs. Barton was active in the Girl  
Scouts. On Wednesday, she was expected at an outing, but never 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Barton's first wife and mother-in-law were bludgeoned  
to death at a campground in northeast Alabama. Authorities said 
Barton was the prime suspect, but he was never charged. The couple 
had two children, who were in Barton's custody after the slayings.
