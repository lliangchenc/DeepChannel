 &HT;    Wife of deadly Atlanta shootings buried

   LIZELLA, Ga. _ Leigh Ann Barton's family buried her Sunday with
little mention of the husband who killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being angry at Mark O. Barton, Pastor Doug Davis
asked the congregation of about 200 mourners in Lizella Baptist
Church not to give into the ``temptation'' of focusing on last
week's ``horrific event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 27 years of wonderful memories of her life and only a
few hours of shocking memories of her death,'' Davis said. ``Let us
remember and celebrate her life today and in the days to come, and
not allow her murder to forever cloud our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was evidence the nation was still focused on Mark O.
Barton's shooting spree Thursday at two Buckhead office buildings,
where he left nine dead and 12 injured. He later shot himself in
the head in an Acworth, Ga. gas station.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 news reporters and photographers lined the roadside in
front of the red brick church southwest of Macon to capture images
of grief for a country that wants to know why. Why a man would kill
his 27-year-old wife and children, Matthew, 11 and Mychelle, 8 with
a hammer?
</P>
<P>
   Church members passed out bottles of spring water and cups of
ice water to sweat-drenched photographers listening to the service
over a loudspeaker outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Leigh Ann Barton's white coffin lay draped with a
blanket of pink roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh Ann loved to take photographs,'' Davis said. ``As a
result, the family has many pictures of Matthew and Mychelle being
accepted and cared for by this large extended family. Indeed,
Matthew and Mychelle were just as much a part of this family as any
of the other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the hymns of ``I'll Fly Away ,'' and ``Amazing Grace''
Davis read a note by Leigh Ann's older sister, Dana Reeves, 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dearest honey,'' the letter began, using the family's
nickname for Leigh Ann Barton. ``I am so very sorry for what has
happened to you. I only wish I could have spared you from all of
this.
</P>
<P>
   After the service a half-dozen pallbearers carried Barton's
coffin past white columns and down a walkway to a waiting blue
hearse. Organ music played from the outside speaker as parishioners
filed out of the church, some sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   One friend among a group of Girl Scouts in uniform cried out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   The blue hearse transported Barton's body to Old Valley Grove
Primitive Baptist Church, about 110 miles south of Macon. The
family decided to bury Barton in a small cemetery next to the Irwin
County church's new social hall. Barton's mother lives in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends who made the trip mingled in front of the new
building before gathering around the burial tent to lay Barton to
rest. Nearby, expansive fields of green soybean and cotton plants
withered in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Davis' words back in Lizella lingered: ``God's love is
stronger than pain. God's love is stronger than death. God's love
is stronger than any sickness than a Mark Barton or anyone else can
dish out.''
