 &HT;    Day traders say shootings `not surprising'

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a
high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
</P>
<P>
   The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day
trader. He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days,
ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he
used.
</P>
<P>
   A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked
about losing money while he was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of
market speculation'' were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member
of the Lakeside Trading Club. ``It was only a matter of time before
someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and
took it out on innocent victims.''
</P>
<P>
   However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where
Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that
Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he
understood the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made
were his own,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second
ahead of the direction of a stock price. Day-traders feed off a
stock's volatile intraday movement. The shares most often traded
are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market,
which processes trades electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech
Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses
where Barton traded. These companies provide staff to help the
traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies
and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to
take advantage of spikes in the prices. At the end of the day, the
trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders
get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers
do.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a
particular stock to sell to customers. They buy or sell stock to
keep an orderly market. Watching the market makers, lets traders
like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public. That step
might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make
a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose
money in their first few months, Borquin said. The ones who last a
year tend to make a living, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one
man would stain an industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,''
Bourquin said. ``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very
little. This guy was just a lunatic. He could have been a mechanic
or a doctor. What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being
a lunatic than him being a day-trader.''
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is day-trading? Here are some answers to commonly
asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David
Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
</P>
<P>
   A: They don't. Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P
futures. The reason? The prices of these tradeable futures
contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite
closely. When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or
widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal. Successful
day traders rarely bet against this market gauge. They buy shares
when the futures suggest the market will rise. Sometimes they're
right. Sometimes they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
</P>
<P>
   A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close
at $125.38. A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost
$300. But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --
a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on
a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest
point. That day trader could have made as much as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
</P>
<P>
   A: Enormous. Investing is inherently risky. Day-trading is
extreme investing and can be extremely risky. Doing it without
proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin
(with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of
unexpected market events. This is not the way to invest your
retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.
