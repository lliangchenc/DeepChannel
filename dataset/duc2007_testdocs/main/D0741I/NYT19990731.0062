   GIVE GREED A CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   As the three-day happening called Woodstock '99 twanged to a
halt, a handful of revelers went wild, setting fires, looting and
even, by some accounts, raping. So now historians, who delight in
drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of
pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round
30-year interval since the original bash.
</P>
<P>
   Take those $4 bottles of water _ a sign of ``Commercialstock,''
as one festival-goer put it. But you don't see people burning up
trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
</P>
<P>
   As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills _ a
close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or
just plain old greed?
</P>
<P>
   Has life become one big violent video game? The reports of
sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has. Has media madness
taken over? Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home
to watch this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a
professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas
mask.
</P>
<P>
   But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it
was wet then, dry now. How does the poem go? ``Some say Woodstock
will end in fire, some say in mud''? Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   What now? Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from
the town that happens to bear that name? Or will the turn of the
millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
</P>
<P>
   And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear
those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?

   A SPOT FOR THE ETHICALLY CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how this society loves its sports stars! It pays them in a
single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year. It puts
them on towering pedestals. It deifies them.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the
mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special. The world's petty
rules don't apply to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider parking spaces for the handicapped. Athletes, one might
reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks. Their
physical prowess is so _ gosh! _ awesome that they should be able
to leap over vast parking lots in a single bound.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of football players at the University of California
at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in
their specialness. Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking
various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting
applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped
parking permits for the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at
all amused. As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse,
protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats
must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean
six months in jail, so the players got off easy. Each one was
suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to
pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service,
half of it with the Special Olympics. That should get them in shape
to jog across a parking lot.

   A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting
rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before
killing himself as the police tried to arrest him. Another 12
people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds. The police later
discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death
in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the
shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district. Officers finally
caught up with him in nearby Cobb County. In a note left near the
bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that
greedily sought my destruction.'' He wrote that he regretted
killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children,
Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living
without parents.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of
his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama. The
authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge
him.
</P>
<P>
   AN ARREST AND A CONFESSION IN THE YOSEMITE MURDERS
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of
three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February
were safely locked away on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the
man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the
motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a
suspect when he was interviewed in February.
