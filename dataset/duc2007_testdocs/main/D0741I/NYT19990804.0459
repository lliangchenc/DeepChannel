 &HT;    `I lost it all:' Debt fueled calculated shootings

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last Christmas, Mark O. Barton sat down with his
estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day
trader in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost it all. I need help,'' he told Leigh Ann Barton, one of
the 12 people he would kill in July in a bloody rampage that
spanned three days and about 30 miles, from Stockbridge to the
office suites of Buckhead, ending in his suicide at a BP service
station in Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   As the story unfolds of a man haunted by mounting debt and
persistent accusations he had killed his first wife, new details
emerge daily about the astounding losses Barton suffered in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Barton lost as much as $450,000 gambling on Internet stocks in
the past year, ventures financed by money he obtained from his
first wife's life insurance settlement and possibly by tapping into
a trust fund set up for his two children, according to family
members and police.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt
to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he
methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock
trading offices in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he
got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't
afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his
sister-in-law, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, about the time his wife left him, Barton went to a
Macon suburb to see Argo and her husband, Gary, Barton's confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The Argos said Barton told them he had lost $250,000 and had
only about $20,000 left. ``He's called Gary before in tears when he
has lost big amounts of money,'' Kelly Argo said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Barton faced Leigh Ann at Christmas, the losses were
approaching $300,000. She was furious with him, Kelly Argo
recalled. But Barton couldn't stop his day trading, nor stem the
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, according to his sister-in-law, Barton told Gary Argo
that he had tapped the children's trust fund and that he was facing
a repayment deadline. If he missed it, he thought he would go to
jail. Later, the Argos said, Barton told them he had obtained the
money and met the repayment deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Barton left All-Tech Investment Group, the
first place he had traded, and went to Momentum Securities Inc. He
eventually gunned down five people at All-Tech, including four
traders, before going across Piedmont Road to Momentum, where he
killed four more.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Barton's debts at the trading offices could not be
verified, because such trading information is not public record.
But the Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, has reported
that Barton lost $400,000 at All-Tech before leaving there in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead
shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts,
according to Atlanta police. Police declined to say how much money
Barton had borrowed from his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the
Buckhead shooting rampage before Barton fled and killed himself
when cornered by police in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to
kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and
to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8,
the same way the next day _ the day before he packed his van with
four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager,
purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve
Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no money,'' Walden said Wednesday. ``He had no
intention of going to pay off his debt _ he knew exactly what he
was going to do over there''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police that the Momentum manager was not
available when Barton first arrived. Barton waited about 25
minutes, exchanging small talk with other traders in the room, and
then could wait no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he began shutting the blinds in the office,''
Walden said. ``Then he closed one of the doors in the office. He
turned around and whipped out two guns, one in each hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire was not erratic or ill-planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a shooting spree,'' Walden said. ``His shots were
intentional. Everyone was shot at close range. Some people had gone
under their desks and he just stepped up to them and fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Atlanta homicide commander Lt. Tony Biello. ``He was
proficient with his firearms and he was methodical.''
