 &HT;    Victim's wife sues three firms, Barton's estate
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first civil lawsuit filed in the Buckhead rampage
that left nine people dead and 13 people wounded claims a
securities firm frequented by mass murderer Mark O. Barton could
have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized
their traders more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc., one of
the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of
Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of
dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed on behalf of Dr. Gulsham Harjee, whose
husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at
All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should
have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent
in the day trading arena. Harjee declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day
trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or
violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to
participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a
threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said. ``Shouldn't these
firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every
day check these people out?'' Barton was losing a lot of money, and
the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief
executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the
suit. ``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious
society, I expected this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harjee is seeking undetermined damages from the Piedmont Center,
Barton Protective Services and Barton's estate. Barton Protective
Services, the company that provides security for the Piedmont
Center, a complex of 11 buildings where All-Tech's offices are
located, is not connected to Mark Barton. The security company's
chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the
suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a
safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks
damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private
duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional
distress and loss of consortium. Harjee also seeks assault and
battery damages against Barton's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech
and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was
a regular. The killings were initiated at Momentum, directly across
the street from All-Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 other people also were wounded. In the two days
before the shootings, Barton also killed his wife and two children,
beating them to death with a claw hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated chemist-turned-day trader killed himself the
night of the multiple murders after two officers surrounded his
minivan at an Acworth gas station.
