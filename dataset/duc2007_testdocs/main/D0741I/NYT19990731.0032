<P>
   ATLANTA _ After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death
with a hammer, and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people
in the brokerage houses where he traded, Mark O. Barton typed a
chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to
live just long enough to kill ``the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which Barton apparently wrote near sunrise Thursday
and then left in the Stockbridge, Ga., apartment where he had
killed his family, suggested that he was tortured by his
estrangement from his wife, by financial troubles and by
unexplained fears that he said had been ``transferred from my
father to me and from me to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Henry County, Ga., which includes the Atlanta suburb
of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities
searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree,
the deadliest in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was
apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials
said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to
snap.
</P>
<P>
   But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's
letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a
remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to
have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, along with recollections from people who knew
Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon
in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his
life. And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage
before.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his
first wife and her mother. The next year, he was under
investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old
daughter. As a course of that investigation, a clinical
psychiatrist evaluated him as someone who was ``certainly capable
of homicidal thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton's mother, Gladys Barton, who lives in South Carolina,
released a statement Friday afternoon saying that she was deeply
saddened by the shootings, but that she loved her son. ``I wish
there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way
it could have been prevented,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's father, Truman, died almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter
that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and
his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain,'' he explained, in the letter, which
police said was left on a living room coffee table. ``All of them
were dead in less than five minutes. I hit them with a hammer in
their sleep and then put them face-down in the bathtub to make sure
they did not wake up in pain, to make sure they were dead. I'm so
sorry. I wish I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton went on: ``Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I? I have
been dying since October. Wake up at night so afraid, so terrified
that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has taken its toll.
I have come to hate this life and this system of things. I have
come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County police said that Leigh Ann
Barton moved out of the couple's rented house in Morrow, Ga., in
October, and moved into the two-bedroom apartment in nearby
Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, he said, Barton and his two children from his
first marriage, showed up at the apartment, needing a place to
live. Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote that he killed his wife because ``she was one of
the main reasons for my demise,'' but then added that he regretted
killing her. ``She really couldn't help it and I love her so much
anyway.'' He said he then killed his children to exchange ``five
minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton also left handwritten notes on top of each child and his
wife, said Chief Jimmy W. Mercer of the Henry County police. Each
note paid brief tribute to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The children had been placed in their beds and covered. A
stuffed teddy bear was left on top of Mychelle's body and a Game
Boy computer on Matthew's. Ms. Barton's body was found in a bedroom
closet, placed behind boxes and under clothes, presumably so that
it would not be discovered by the children, Mercer said. He said
the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
</P>
<P>
   Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice
similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of
his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise
Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer,
bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade. But he denied killing them.
``There's no reason for me to lie now,'' he wrote. ``It just seemed
like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Alabama slayings at a lakeside campground near
Cedar Bluff, Barton's dark, troubled side was hardly unknown to the
authorities. And several months later, in February of 1994, Georgia
child welfare officials and the Douglas County, Ga., district
attorney's office began an investigation after Barton's daughter,
then 3, told a day care worker that he had molested her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely concerned because of the context, that he
was the prime suspect in a murder case,'' said David McDade, the
district attorney, who said the reports he read ``make me shudder
to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody
because the child was too young to testify, McDade said. But during
the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist
who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal
thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators
said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on
his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be
having marital problems, and because he was already having an
affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann
Vandiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still
is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found traces of what they thought might be blood
in Barton's car, but before they could conduct further tests, the
chemist told them he had spilled a soft drink on the area, ruining
any potential evidence. He gave what they felt were ``rehearsed''
answers to questions and refused to take a polygraph test,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he was not charged was they could not place him
inside the campground,'' said Paul Dale, then a reserve captain in
the Cherokee County, Ala., sheriff's department. Dale, who was one
of the first officers on the scene, said there were no fingerprints
or witnesses. `'When I heard the name, and heard the way the two
kids and the second wife died, it didn't come as a real surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor's Life Insurance of Nebraska, which issued the policy,
settled Barton's claim for $450,000, with $150,000 going to a trust
fund for the children, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been carrying on an affair with Ms. Vandiver, a
co-worker at a chemical company, Lintech International, where he
had been a salesman and she a customer services assistant, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1993, a month after the slaying of his first wife,
Ms. Vandiver divorced her husband, David K. Lang. A year later,
both left their jobs at Lintech, according to Julie H. Van Brunt,
the company's administrative manager, who declined to discuss the
reasons for the resignations. They were married on May 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They lived in Morrow, a middle-class suburb south of Atlanta,
where their house at 6475 Sinclair Place was notable only for the
multiple phone lines and banks of computers on which Barton did his
work, mostly at home. He dressed in casual clothes and helped out
with the local boy scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent months had been troubled, apparently at least
partly because of financial problems due to Barton's losses as a
high-risk day trader. As winter came, a neighbor, Cindy A.
Northcutt, said the children confided to her that Ms. Barton had
left her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In May, she said, Barton held a yard sale. But it was not the
type that people have to get rid of old, unused junk. She said it
seemed as though Barton was trying to sell virtually every item of
furniture he possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the unsolved murders of his first wife and
mother-in-law, Barton had been quietly pursued by his former
father-in-law, William Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that if those people in Alabama had done their job
that there'd be 12 people alive,'' Spivey said in an interview,
fighting to contain his outrage that it took the Atlanta shooting
spree to spark fuller scrutiny of the earlier slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police and political leaders remained grim and
devastated Friday as they reviewed the details of Thursday's
carnage. In addition to the eight men and one woman who were
killed, 13 people were injured, some of them critically, in the two
brokerage houses where Barton sprayed fire with two handguns. Ten
people remained hospitalized Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Allen C. Tenenbaum, 48, a synagogue president
and father of three who was killed while visiting All-Tech
Investment Group Inc., held the first funeral for a victim Friday.
Gov. Roy E. Barnes ordered that flags at the state Capitol be flown
at half-staff and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell announced that a
citywide interfaith memorial service would be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Barton visited the office of his lawyer,
Joseph H. Fowler, to work on some ``routine will and estate
issues,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Barton's wife and children were found at about
3:30 p.m. that day, shortly after he had finished his shooting
spree in Atlanta's Buckhead financial and entertainment district.
They were discovered by an apartment manager who had been called by
a concerned co-worker of Ms. Barton, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police chief, Beverly Harvard, said that police
received their first emergency call at 2:56 p.m. from a woman
reporting that shots had been fired in the offices of Momentum
Securities Inc. at Two Securities Centre on Buckhead's bustling
Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barton spent about 30 minutes at the office, where he
had been trading for several months, before pulling his weapons and
firing. ``He had made comments to the extent that it was a bad
trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get
worse,'' Ms. Harvard said. Four people were killed in that office.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, president of the Houston-based company, said Friday
that Barton met the firm's financial requirements for trading and
had signed documents saying he understood the risks of day trading.
He did not say whether Barton had suffered significant losses.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:07 p.m., Barton had crossed Piedmont Road and entered
All-Tech's office in Building 8 of the sprawling Piedmont Center
office complex, where he had traded until April. ``He acted
normally and said he hoped he wasn't disturbing anyone's trading
day,'' said Linda Lerner, the general counsel of the Montvale,
N.J.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner said Barton entered the branch manager's office and
spoke to him and his secretary for several minutes before pulling
his weapons and shooting the two employees. Both were seriously
injured but survived, she said. In the ensuing shooting spree,
however, five customers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harvard said Friday that Barton fired 40 rounds from his 9
mm Glock semiautomatic handgun and his .45-caliber Colt
semiautomatic pistol. She said he purchased the Glock in 1993 from
a gun shop in Warner Robins, Ga., and had properly registered it.
</P>
<P>
   The Colt, however, was registered to a Texas man who bought the
gun in 1983, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Ms. Harvard said she did not know
how Barton had obtained the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A third gun, a .22-caliber pistol, also was recovered by
authorities at the apartment, but the ATF spokesman said it
apparently was not involved in this week's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Two other weapons, an H&AMP;R .22-caliber pistol that Barton
purchased from a South Carolina pawnshop in 1976 and a .25-caliber
Raven semiautomatic pistol that was purchased from a Georgia
pawnshop in 1992 by someone else, were found in the van where
Barton killed himself, the spokesman said. Police also found 200
rounds of ammunition in the van.
</P>
<P>
   After Barton escaped, police first learned of his whereabouts
when he tried to steal a woman's car at 7:40 p.m. at Town Center
Mall in Cobb County, northwest of Buckhead, according to Cobb
County police.
</P>
<P>
   By about 8 p.m., police had trailed Barton's green Aerostar
minivan to a BP service station in nearby Acworth, where he killed
himself as officers approached him with guns drawn, Ms. Harvard
said.
