<HEADLINE> Ga. Brokerage Massacre Remembered  </HEADLINE>

   DECATUR, Ga. (AP) -- It's been a painful year for the families
and friends of the nine people killed last summer at two Atlanta
brokerage offices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them came together to share their experiences at a
memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church Sunday, a year and a
day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through
All-Tech Investment Group's trading office.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Webb, whose brother Scott Webb was killed July 29, 1999,
said she decided to visit the building where her brother traded and
died. But it didn't ease her grief, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never leaves,'' Webb said after the service, wiping tears
from her eyes. ''It never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   The service was organized by Dr. Gulshan Harjee, whose husband
was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech and Momentum Securities.
Harjee said she hoped the service might allow victims' families to
visit and offer each other solace.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Barton, who had reportedly lost more than $400,000
from his investments, killed his wife and two young children the
day before his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The three -- Leigh Ann Barton, and her children, Matthew and
Michelle -- were included in the service bulletin, and a candle for
each victim was lighted at the front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the shooting, Barton fatally shot himself when
police stopped his minivan at a convenience store northwest of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has prompted close public scrutiny of the industry,
in which people rapidly buy and sell shares electronically, hoping
to profit from the market's slight price swings.
</P>
<P>
   Victims and their relatives also have filed 10 lawsuits in the
past year, naming as defendants the brokerages, their landlords,
their security firms and Barton's estate.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, the focus remained the pain of loss and the search
for strength coping with it. About 2,000 people attended the
ecumenical service at The Cathedral at Chapel Hill, an
interdenominational church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes survival depends on our ability to cry, to feel the
hurt,'' said Archbishop Earl Paulk, the church's founder, urging
the families to strive for a ''sense of forgiveness'' even if they
consider Barton's actions unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, ''it's no longer who was wrong, it's no longer who
made the mistake, it's about how we deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some at the service, dealing with it is almost a full-time
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day, it's a reminder. Every single day,'' said
Shala Havash, whose brother, Jamshid Havash, was killed. ''I can't
forget that day.''
