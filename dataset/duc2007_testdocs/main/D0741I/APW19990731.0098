<HEADLINE>  Cops: Barton Vowed To Avoid Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- Long considered the only suspect in the  
hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama, 
Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that he would never go to jail,'' Danny Smith  
recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton upheld the vow. He committed suicide hours after a  
killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two 
trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly  
slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise 
Spivey, in 1993. Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 
life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side. 
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one  
thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the 
camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a 
hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said  
Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's 
office. ``We didn't have any fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading  
offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others. Afterward, his wife and 
two children were found dead in their apartment. They had been 
beaten with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton  
acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the 
Alabama killings. But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for 
me to lie now,'' denied committing the '93 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities  
said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but 
believed they did all they could. Barton was the only suspect ever 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,''  
Smith said. ``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not 
prove it legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were found dead inside a blood-splattered trailer at a  
campground along Weiss Lake. As many as 600 people were at the 
campground when the women were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper  
door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the 
shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton. Police talked with 
everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered 
seeing Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible  
presence of blood around the front seat. But before police could 
analyze the spot again, Barton -- a chemist -- claimed to have 
spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential 
evidence, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after 
he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview. He also refused 
a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out  
about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took 
effect less than a month before she was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came  
to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of  
Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided 
all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children. 
Barton refused and eventually settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with  
$150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the 
remainder going to Barton and his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's  
second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating 
during his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily  
News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover 
up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy. 
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Barton remarried, he would periodically call Smith and ask  
why he was a suspect in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a game to him. He got mad at me one time because he  
couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.
