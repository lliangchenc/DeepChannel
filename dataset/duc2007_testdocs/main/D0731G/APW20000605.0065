<HEADLINE> White House Must Produce E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the White House on
Monday to retrieve e-mails from President Clinton and the first
lady and 31 presidential aides concerning the FBI files
controversy, Linda Tripp and presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit brought by a conservative group, U.S. District
Judge Royce Lamberth ordered e-mails produced within 20 days in the
case of hundreds of appointees from the Reagan and Bush
administrations whose FBI background files were gathered by the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for a search of White House computer archives,
Lamberth said he will deal later with the problem that 100,000 or
more e-mails were not archived and are being reconstructed from
computer back-up tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative group, Judicial Watch, is trying to prove that
the Clinton administration routinely attacked its political enemies
by using confidential material protected by the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is allowing the conservative group to delve into two
side issues -- the use of information from Linda Tripp's personnel
file at the Pentagon and the White House's release of personal
letters of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
