<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Testifies Against Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky appeared Thursday in a court in Maryland state of
the United States and testified against his former confidant Linda
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky testified that she felt violated to learn Tripp had
secretly recorded her intimate conversations about her affair with
President Bill Clinton and the telephone talks appeared in a
magazine.
</P>
<P>
"It terrified me," Lewinsky said at a pretrial hearing for
Tripp. "I was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being
revealed."
</P>
<P>
The tapes that revealed her relationship with Clinton had led
to the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's testimony will determine whether Tripp stands trial
on state wiretapping charges.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky said she was sure the taped conversation actually took
place on December 22, 1997. The date is crucial to the case
against Tripp as she is charged only with making the tape on that
date and allowing it to be played for Newsweek magazine although
she made more than 20 hours of tapes.
</P>
<P>
Tripp is charged with one count of making a tape recording of
conversation with Lewinsky on December 22 after she had been
informed that it was illegal to do so in Maryland and another
count of turning that tape to a Newsweek reporter.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the two criminal charges, Tripp could face a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 20,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's testimony was Lewinsky's opportunity to get back at
her former friend Tripp. As the investigation of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr on Cliton's sex scandal wrapped up in 1998,
Lewinsky said tearfully that "I hate Linda Tripp" at a federal
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, a Pentagon employee, did not appear at the hearing but
her son, Ryan Tripp, watched Lewinsky testify.
