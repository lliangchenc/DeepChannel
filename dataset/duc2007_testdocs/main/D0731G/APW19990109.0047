<HEADLINE> Report: Tripp Seeks Legal Fee Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise  
money for her legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, whose recordings of conversations with White House  
intern Monica Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, is 
sending about 20,000 fund-raising letters ``urgently'' asking for 
contributions to her defense fund, The Washington Post reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her legal bills are already more than $325,000 and ``growing  
every day,'' Mrs. Tripp said in the 12-page letter. 
</P>
<P>
	She describes herself as ``David up against Goliath'' in fending  
off the attacks of Clinton's ``disciples'' and ``henchmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who lives in Columbia, is being investigated by a  
Maryland grand jury for taping her phone conversations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Maryland law forbids taping another person without their 
knowledge and consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp earns $90,767 a year in her Pentagon public affairs  
job, according to The Post.
