<HEADLINE> Court: Info in Tripp Case Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A prosecutor does not have to release a  
summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury 
to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest 
court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned a judge's order  
involving State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, had argued for the  
material to be made public alleging that political pressure from 
the Clinton administration drove the grand jury to investigate 
whether Ms. Tripp broke Maryland law by recording phone 
conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	However, public information law ``does not trump or override the  
traditional rule of grand jury secrecy,'' according to the opinion 
written by Chief Justice Robert Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp was indicted in July on charges of illegally taping a  
December 1997 phone conversation with Ms. Lewinsky and for 
illegally directing her attorney to disclose its contents to 
Newsweek magazine. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation  
into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
