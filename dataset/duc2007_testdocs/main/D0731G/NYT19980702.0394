TRIPP RETURNS TO GRAND JURY FOR 7 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here
Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors,
apparently explaining her motives for secretly recording 20 hours
of phone conversations with her ex-friend and former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's lawyers and supporters presented the public with a
freshly burnished image of Mrs. Tripp as an honest person motivated
only by the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In refuting the suggestion that Mrs. Tripp betrayed the trust of
a vulnerable woman half her age, a person close to Mrs. Tripp's
legal team suggested that Mrs. Tripp had tried several times last
fall to end her friendship with Ms. Lewinsky, who would sometimes
call and e-mail Mrs. Tripp ``20 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, 48, a Pentagon employee, had grown tired of Ms.
Lewinsky's ``constant talk'' of her alleged relationship with
President Clinton, the person said. ``Please give me a break,''
Mrs. Tripp wrote in an e-mail that she sent to Ms. Lewinsky last
October, according to one person familiar with it. ``I can't take
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait suggests that Mrs. Tripp was a reluctant confidante
who had grown weary of Ms. Lewinsky's attempts to discuss her
relationship with Clinton and the attempts by lawyers for Paula
Jones to quiz both women under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mrs. Tripp told The Washington Post, ``I did
not cultivate Monica _ she cultivated me. Monica is a very worldly
person. She educated me.'' Two people close to Mrs. Tripp said she
is disgusted by the suggestions in the media that she recorded her
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky to try to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Tripp, who was accompanied by two
lawyers and a family friend, arrived at the federal courthouse
here, saying nothing as she headed to the third floor grand jury
room. Her appearance was met with far less hoopla than her first
day on Tuesday, when she was greeted by 300 reporters and a crowd
of tourists and onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   After the grand jury recessed for the day, one of her lawyers
said that Mrs. Tripp was ``very encouraged by the quality and the
content of the questions presented by the grand jurors and by the
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Joseph Murtha refused to say what questions Mrs.
Tripp had been asked, but said that she would return, at a
still-unscheduled date, to continue testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several days, many of you have asked the
question, how is Linda doing?'' Murtha told reporters on the steps
of the federal courthouse. ``Well, if there is any truth in the
adage that an honest person's pillow is her peace of mind, I can
assure you that Linda Tripp will sleep very well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is seen as one of the most important witnesses to
appear before the grand jury in the five-month-old inquiry led by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Mrs. Tripp brought the 20 hours
of tape recordings to Starr's prosecutors on Jan. 12, and told them
that Ms. Lewinsky had encouraged her to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have said that her appearance is intended to send a
message to Ms. Lewinsky that time is running out for her to strike
an immunity deal and cooperate with Starr's inquiry. If she does
not, they say, she almost certainly will be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who has very low approval ratings in public opinion
polls, is seeking support on her own web site. ``The Official Linda
Tripp Web Site'' (http://lindatripp.com) includes an address for
Mrs. Tripp's legal defense fund, reprinted news articles and a
chance to send in for the ``I Believe Linda Tripp'' bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   In a note accompanied by her smiling photograph, Mrs. Tripp
said, ``In the end, this investigation is not about left or right,
it's about right and wrong.'' &QL;
