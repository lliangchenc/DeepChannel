<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp Agrees to Interviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose taped conversations with  
Monica Lewinsky sparked President Clinton's impeachment crisis, has 
agreed to interviews with NBC's ``Today'' show and CNN's ``Larry 
King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's ``Today'' interview, a pre-taped talk with  
correspondent Jamie Gangel, will air Friday morning shortly after 
7:30 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll talk live with King in prime time the following Monday,  
Feb. 15, CNN said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who worked in the White House counsel's office  
before being transferred to the Pentagon, befriended Ms. Lewinsky 
and got her to talk about her relationship with Clinton while 
secretly taping their talks. She's yet to give an extensive 
interview about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangel repeatedly requested the interview over an eight-month  
period, ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said. It was Mrs. 
Tripp's choice to do the interview on tape instead of live, and 
Gangel will speak to her on Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're interested in what her thoughts are now that the  
trial is almost over and how this has affected her life,'' Zucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second big interview on this story landed by ``Today.''  
The top-rated morning program featured a Matt Lauer interview with 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shortly after the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to speak to ABC's Barbara Walters first,  
but that interview can't be done until Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr grants permission. ABC had been hoping to run the interview 
during the February ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, was not available for  
comment.
