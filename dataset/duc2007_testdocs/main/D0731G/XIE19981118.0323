<HEADLINE> U.S. House Releases Linda Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House investigators on
Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of
Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee released 22 hours of the tapes,
which triggered independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation
into the Lewinsky case and led to his report to Congress alleging
impeachable offenses by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, an edited transcript of the tapes was made
public in October. House audio technicians went through the tapes
line by line to take out the same material removed from the
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
Tripp secretly recorded the tapes of Lewinsky, talking about
her affair with the president, and took the tapes to Starr,
sparking his eight-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an
impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first
witness on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tripp is now being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for
allegedly violating a state law that requires all parties to a
conversation to consent to any taping.
