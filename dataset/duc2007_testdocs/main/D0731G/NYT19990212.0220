   WASHINGTON _ The woman who alienated all America when she stood
on the steps of the Washington District courthouse and said: ``I'm
you...an average American,'' emerged Friday from half a year of
obscurity to start rebuilding her shattered image.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, whose clandestine taping of Monica Lewinsky's most
intimate confessions won her the label ``most reviled woman in
America,'' was back as suddenly as she had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a new Linda Tripp, so comprehensively ``made over''
as to be almost unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy, clumsy, boxy woman whose ponderous frame inspired
Linda Tripp look-alike contests in gay bars across the country has
lost weight (a lot), softened her hair and her make-up and revamped
her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   She is fragile _ breaking down in tears, reportedly, during a
two-hour interview with the New York Times _ but largely
unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   Her deepest regret, she said, was the pain she had caused her
young friend, Monica. She said she saw Monica ``as a kid'' and
wanted to save her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw her as a lost soul,'' she told the paper. ``I
believe she and the country will never understand that I believed
this was in her best interest, and that makes me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   By revealing the tapes, she says, she wanted to ``sever''
Monica's relationship with the president once and for all. ``This
was a young girl who...fell head over heels in love with the
president. He clearly did not share those feelings, and his callous
abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made it look as if he thought
of her as a servicing contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica
(her daughter is 19),'' she said amid tears, ``I would hope some
other mom would do for my daughter what I did for Monica, despite
the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times interview, which appeared Friday, was the
first of three, so far announced. She also appeared Friday on the
NBC morning ``Today'' program, and will be on CNN's Larry King Live
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She insists, however, that she has no plans to write a book,
though it was her idea for a book-length expose of scandal in the
Clinton White House that inspired her to record her conversations
with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   As she told the New York Times, she blames the New York literary
agent whom she contacted _ Lucianne Goldberg _ for prompting what
are perceived as some of her more egregious acts of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goldberg, she said, who suggested she passed her tapes to
the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who
suggested she talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman
suing Clinton for sexual harassment. (Goldberg had no comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, 49, remains employed by the Pentagon but has worked from
home since the Lewinsky affair broke.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of her ``relaunch'' on the metropolitan media
circuit was the surest sign that the 13-month scandal was drawing
to a close. &QL;
