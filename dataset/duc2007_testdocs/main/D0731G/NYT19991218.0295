   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 19:

   The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state
wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have
been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial. On one
side are those who view the pursuit of Mrs. Tripp as a vindictive
selective prosecution designed to punish her for exposing White
House misconduct. On the other side are those who take a dim view
of her betrayal of the young woman she befriended and of Kenneth
Starr's independent counsel office. They see her current legal
troubles as a matter of poetic justice.
</P>
<P>
   Remove this emotional overlay, however, and the case seems more
mundane _ a valid effort to enforce Maryland's privacy law, which
prohibits recording telephone conversations without the consent of
the person being recorded. Ignoring such a well-publicized
violation would have weakened the statute's deterrent value and
made it harder for the state to justify prosecutions of less
notorious violations in the future. As for accusations of political
revenge, the case was brought by a special state prosecutor,
Stephen Montanarelli, who has a reputation for being nonpartisan.
</P>

   It remains to be determined whether Mrs. Tripp's immunity
agreement with Starr's office leaves room for the state
prosecution. The prosecutor must show that none of his evidence
against her was the result of work by the independent counsel's
office after immunity was granted. That task was made easier last
week when the presiding judge ruled that Mrs. Tripp's immunity
applied only to evidence she gave to federal prosecutors after Feb.
19, 1998, rather than a month earlier. The judge based that
decision on a failure by Starr's office to get a court to ratify
the agreement immediately. The timing of the immunity is one of
several legal issues that will affect the judge's decision on going
to trial. In fairness to Mrs. Tripp, an administrative error by
Starr's office, if there was one, should not be the determining
factor.
