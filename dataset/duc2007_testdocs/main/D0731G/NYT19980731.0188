ONE THING LINDA TRIPP IS NOT: A VICTIM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking
around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his
investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed
silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and
making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a
response.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her
final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex
Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing
herself off as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position,'' Tripp
declared.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of people who could honestly claim that
they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe. Bill
Clinton never asked. Monica Lewinsky never asked. The Secret
Service never asked. Even Starr never asked _ at least not before
Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the
independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the
sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this
country for six months. But Tripp not only invited herself into
this mess _ she started it.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with
Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with
Clinton. It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news
media to the existence of the tapes. It was Tripp who reportedly
baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to
lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved? Maybe she's right. She
``demanded'' to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look
upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her
role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of
the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the
embodiment of the ``average American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation
about just who I am and how I got here,'' she said. ``Well, the
answer is simple. I'm you. I'm just like you. I'm an average
American who found herself in a situation not of her own making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's us? She's an average American?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash. Average Americans don't tape private
conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends;
they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something
illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root
through their friends' sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   The average American is not a scheming, back-stabbing,
double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred
for a politician than help a friend who's clearly in need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining
about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian
spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid
prevaricators.''
</P>
<P>
   She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either. But
she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president
she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young
woman who trusted her.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target
for vilification. No one who is inventive enough to touch off a
scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so
naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad,
depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an
average American. And she is not a victim, though she has
victimized others.
</P>
<P>
   She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would
retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.
