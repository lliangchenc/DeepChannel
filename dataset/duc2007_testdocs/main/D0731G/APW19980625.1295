	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica
Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill
Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week,
one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday.
	   Word of her scheduled appearance comes as special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr tries to negotiate agreement for the cooperation of
Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern who alleged in
conversations with Tripp a presidential affair and cover-up.
	   Joe Murtha, a Tripp lawyer, said the grand jury subpoenaed Tripp
on Thursday.
	   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly would not comment.
