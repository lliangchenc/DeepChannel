VERDICT FROM WOMEN: IMPEACH LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling
book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she
thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that news got out, you could hear women gasp all over
America,'' Traeder said. ``It was and still is a hair-raising
thought: your trusted friend taping your phone conversations. Most
women consider their girlfriend relationships as sacred as a
confessional.''
</P>
<P>
   Traeder and her coauthor, Carmen Renee Berry, have learned a lot
about women's values since ``Girlfriends'' (Wildcat Canyon Press),
quietly invaded female America in 1995. Now in its 27th printing,
the paperback just passed the one-million-books mark and has
spawned ``The Girlfriends Keepsake Book'' as well as a sequel,
``Girlfriends For Life,'' which will be published this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you never know as a publisher _ unless you're
producing someone like Tom Clancy _ is what book will take off,''
said Roy Carlisle, of Wildcat Canyon's mother ship, Circulus
Publishing Group Inc. in Berkeley, Calif. ``Books that do become
really big sellers always articulate some very powerful feeling
that is right below the surface of the culture, something not quite
in the consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pretty clearly is what happened with `Girlfriends.' This
thing of women's deep friendships is not a kind of fad; it's a
serious reality for women in this culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they collaborated on their book of essays, interviews and
featured quotations, Traeder and Berry ``thought they were
special'' because of the high quality of their female friendships.
Both women had been through periods of crisis, loss and change in
the early '90s and believed they might not have survived without
the love, understanding and support of their closest
``girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing the book _ and riding its amazing wave of success _ has
shown the authors that they are not at all unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every woman has at least one woman she feels this way
about: She's my support; she doesn't judge me; she's always there
for me; I trust her completely; I tell her everything,'' Traeder
said. ``The letters we've received about the first book just amazed
us. That's why we decided to do `Girlfriends For Life.' People have
written tomes, some five and six pages long, about their
friendships. They're really quite moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Divided into dozens of mini-chapters such as, ``She's As Crazy
As I Am'' and ``Helping Us Change (Even When We'd Rather Not),''
``Girlfriends'' is not a deep book. But it is as wide as the sea
and just as accessible. Reading anecdotes from other women tends to
start a recall-and-analysis process for even the casual peruser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go, women keep thanking us for making them think
about their friendships and see how blessed they are to have
them,'' Traeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Why, given the significance of our female friendships, has so
little attention been paid them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because they're usually such easy
relationships,'' Traeder said. ``We tend to focus our attention and
energy on relationships that are more trouble _ the ones with men,
our families, our kids, our co-workers. When something goes wrong
with a girlfriend, it's rare and it's really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like when your girlfriend secretly tapes your most
intimate phone conversations, then turns them over to the feds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine how Monica Lewinsky could ever reconnect or
put herself out there again to trust,'' Traeder said. ``For many
women, their girlfriends are the healers, the people who help them
recover from life's blows, from dramatic changes and problems and
bad relationships. And Linda Tripp wasn't just a girlfriend, she
was a mentor, an older woman Monica looked to for help and
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Traeder and Berry wrote in ``Girlfriends'' in 1995: ``By
telling our stories, we learn about relationships. These stories
tell us how to treat each other _ what is acceptable, what is
honorable and what is not ... With our girlfriends we peel back
many layers of our personalities. This process is an intimate and,
we believe, sacred undertaking. Anyone who has shown that
willingness to expose their darkest secrets or greatest fears to
another woman understands the treasure of a trusted girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who violates that sacred undertaking ought to be
impeached _ from the human race.
