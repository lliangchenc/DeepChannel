</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were close friends, so close that the younger
woman could confide in the older woman some of her most intimate
secrets about a dangerous affair she was having with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   And the older woman did not hesitate to pass on some motherly
advice.
</P>
<P>
   It was Linda Tripp who recommended to Monica Lewinsky that she
hang on to the now infamous blue dress stained from an encounter
with the president, Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box
because it could be evidence one day,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said that was ludicrous because I would never _ I would
never disclose that I had a relationship with the president. I
would never need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no transcripts of her tapes or testimony were included
in Monday's document release, Tripp recorded more than 40 telephone
conversations with Lewinsky, 38 times on her own and twice while
cooperating with the FBI. Copies of some e-mail messages between
the two friends were included in the 2,800 pages of material
released Monday with the videotape of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In chatty, even schoolgirlish electronic messages, Lewinsky and
Tripp shared laughs and then lunched regularly as Lewinsky came to
rely on Tripp's advice in trying to deal with the ups and downs of
her relationship with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Once, early in 1997, when Clinton ignored Lewinsky for a time,
Lewinsky e-mailed Tripp of her worries about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for you!'' she wrote to Tripp. ``I don't know what
I'm going to do. I just don't understand what went wrong, what
happened? How could he do this to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp wrote back with reassurance: ``Do not despair, there is
most definitely light at the end of this tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also collected newspapers containing a Valentine message
that Lewinsky wrote for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It read beautifully,'' Tripp complimented Lewinsky.
``Placement was great, typeface totally effective and text
superlative . . . good job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky returned from a vacation shortly after the ad's
publication, she wrote to Tripp, ``Hi. I missed you!'' (with four
exclamation points).
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Lewinsky complained that Clinton failed to
call even though ``the Babba,'' her name for Hillary Rodham
Clinton, was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``HHHEEELLPPP!!!!'' she wrote to Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during these intimacies when Tripp may have been
plotting to turn on the younger woman, according to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has said she did not set out to betray Lewinsky and was
only trying to do the right thing. But Tripp had already befriended
book agent Lucianne Goldberg to peddle an account of Tripp's last
moments with Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who
shot himself in 1993. (Tripp was the last of his co-workers to see
him alive.)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp took copious notes on her phone conversations with
Lewinsky in handwritten pages torn from a small, spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   One notation Tripp made reads: ``6:00 (?) night he called at
home _ come over. romantic. If I win in Nov. I'll have you back
like that! fooled around. phone call from Dick Morris _ (oral sex)
on phone. Harold came in _ she went out and never (got a)
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they had a falling out over what to tell investigators
in the Paula Jones lawsuit, Lewinsky tried to maintain the
friendship and, unaware of the depth of Tripp's betrayal, ask for
her help in concealing the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Lewinsky repeatedly refers to Tripp's
intention to ``rat on me'' to lawyers for Paula Jones. By January
of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky
testified, but thought she still had a chance of persuading her to
keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in
the Jones suit.
</P>
<P>
   They arranged to meet for lunch at a mall. Tripp was beginning
to see Lewinsky's point of view, or so she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was late. I saw her come down the escalator. And as I, as
I walked toward her, she kind of motioned behind her and (two
government agents) presented themselves to me,'' Lewinsky
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp had set her up, claiming it was for her own good, Lewinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that they had done the same thing to her and she
tried to hug me, and she told me this was the best thing for me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lewinsky made it plain in her testimony to the
independent counsel how she feels about Tripp. At the end of her
Aug. 20 testimony, Lewinsky is asked by a grand juror if there is
anything she wanted to add or clarify. Lewinsky said she wanted to
make sure jurors knew that no one asked her to lie and that she was
not promised a job for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that I'm sorry,'' she added, beginning to cry. ``I'm
really sorry for everything that's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hate Linda Tripp.'' &QL;
