<HEADLINE> Land Mine Menace in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>

   ZAWTAR SHARQIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- Boyish curiosity drew Ammar
Serhal to an abandoned Israeli position near his village, one of
scores of bases and checkpoints hastily vacated as Israel ended its
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   There, the 12-year-old discovered that though the shooting and
shelling of the volatile occupation years was over, Lebanon had not
seen the end of the heartache. On the very day Israel pulled out --
May 24 -- he stepped on an antipersonnel mine that chopped off his
left leg above the knee and badly damaged his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   International anti-mine campaigners said Thursday that a global
treaty against the use of mines has made a difference in the first
year and a half of its life, but problems remain. Countries that
have ratified the treaty were to meet in Switzerland next week.
Neither Israel nor Lebanon has signed the treaty.

<P>
   According to police, nine people have died and 62 others injured
in explosions of land mines and unexploded shells since the Israeli
withdrawal from the border zone it held in Lebanon for 18 years as
a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officers estimate at least 50,000 mines were planted, most
by Israel and its Lebanese militia allies in their fight against
elusive guerrillas. Guerrillas also planted mines.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese authorities had planned an awareness campaign to warn
people of the danger of mines and unexploded shells. The Israelis'
withdrawal six weeks ahead of their self-declared deadline of July
7 lent urgency to the brochures, posters and warnings on radio and
television, which began just as the first casualties started coming
in. Thousands of people flooded south Lebanon after Israeli troops
left to return home or to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, Ammar ventured to the vacated hilltop Israeli
position of Ali Taher, from where his Shiite Muslim village of
Zawtar Sharqiyeh, 47 miles southeast of Beirut, had been targeted
by gunfire and shelling almost every day during the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Ammar said the mine that maimed him did not kill his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I will still be able to become a history teacher and
draw paintings as I always wanted. But I don't think I will be able
to play soccer anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are clearing mines in
the southern region which, counting the former Israeli-occupied
zone and the front line, amounts to more than 10 percent of
Lebanese territory. The effort is hindered by the difficult
terrain, lack of maps and limited funding.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said $8.6 million was needed to clear the
south of land mines.
