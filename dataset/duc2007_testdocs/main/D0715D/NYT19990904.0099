   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,
production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be
as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of
civil war in Kosovo. So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were
fighting. Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks
against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan
(and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping
some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
</P>
<P>
   Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India
and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil
wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to
Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that
governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines
in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it
officially went into force. Among those were three that signed the
treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country
Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major
countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United
States, Russia and China, mostof the nations in the Middle East and
many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the
coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to
write off the treaty as a failure. On the contrary, they point to
progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide
production of mines and their availability in the international
arms market, according to arms control monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service
in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban
have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the
treaty was written two years ago. Even countries that have so far
refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia
_ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain
kinds altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public
perception. Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans,
of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a
minefield in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one
thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Everybody is aware that
mines were used in Kosovo. The treaty is setting a new
international standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the
eradication of mines another.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are cheap and durable and deadly. In Yugoslavia, which has
not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes
along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the
Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that
forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav
fire. Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked
Albanian homes to keeP refugees from returning home. (Many returned
anyway, and died as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty _ the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months
after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
</P>
<P>
   There is no governing organization to oversee it and no
mechanism to punish those who violate it. It essentially relies on
member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what
stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force
nations to comply. ``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines
overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study
on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that
the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States
won't sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to
pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's
restrictions. They insist they need the most common type of land
mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea
from North Korea. They also want to keep using ``smart''
anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct
after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not
prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough
to trigger them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future
_ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a
process critics say has moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody questions the fact that we would be much
further along if the United States was not only a participant in
the treaty, but an active one,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
one of the most ardent advocates of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will
say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful
country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land
mines?'''
