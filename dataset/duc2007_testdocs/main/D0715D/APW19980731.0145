Government bans last exemption for land mine use
</HEADLINE>

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's ban on land mines will become total with
the elimination of an exemption for ``exceptional circumstances,''
the government said Friday.
	   On July 10, under pressure to show support for Princess Diana's
final campaign against land mines before the anniversary of her
death Aug. 31, the House of Commons rushed through a bill ratifying
the international treaty banning their use.
	   But it will not come into effect for some months, until at least
40 of the more than 120 signatories have ratified it.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had imposed a moratorium
on the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by British
forces in May. An exemption was allowed for the weapons' use in
exceptional circumstances, such as to defend an occupied zone.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson said Friday that a total ban
was being implemented to send a ``clear signal'' to the rest of the
world.
	   Robertson, speaking to BBC radio before making a formal
announcement to Parliament, said a concerted effort must be made to
get countries that have not signed the convention to do so.
	   Removing the exemption would reinforce Britain's position, he
said.
	   ``We will wipe that away now to make sure that a very clear
signal goes out to the rest of the world,'' he told BBC.
	   ``We must now go out there and use Britain's moral authority to
make sure that our position becomes the international standard,''
he said.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but would not come
into force for at least another nine months. It has to be ratified
by a minimum of 40 countries.
	   Half of Britain's one million landmines have already been
destroyed.
