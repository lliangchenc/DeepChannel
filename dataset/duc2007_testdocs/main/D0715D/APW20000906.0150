<HEADLINE> Land Mine Ban Making a Difference  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON

   GENEVA (AP) -- A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has
made a significant difference in its first 18 months, but major
blackspots -- among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain,
anti-mine campaigners said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Angola continues to use the weapons although it has signed the
treaty, while Burundi and Sudan ''likely'' do so, according to the
Landmine Monitor 2000 report. Sudan has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The study said Yugoslav forces laid some 50,000 land mines
during the Kosovo conflict and that Chechnya also saw heavy laying
of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by the Nobel laureate International
Campaign to Ban Landmines, will be presented next week to a Geneva
meeting of countries that have ratified a 1997 treaty outlawing the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have turned the tide in the battle against mines,'' the
1,121-page report said. It found that trade in the weapons has
almost completely halted, with no shipments recorded this year or
last.
</P>
<P>
   Since the treaty came into force on March 1 last year, some 10
million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed,
bringing the total so far to 22 million, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimated that more than 250 million mines remain
stockpiled in 105 nations.
</P>
<P>
   China leads the list with some 110 million mines, followed by
Russia with 60-70 million, Belarus with 10-15 million and the
United States with 11 million, it said. Ukraine, Pakistan and India
each were estimated to have stocks of more than 4 million mines.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of deaths and injuries were ''sketchy and
incomplete,'' the study conceded. But it found marked decreases in
countries including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Still, new land mine victims have been recorded in 71 countries,
more than half of them at peace, it said. In Kosovo, 492 deaths and
injuries were recorded in the year to May; in Chechnya,
''hundreds'' were suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Since the treaty came into effect the weapons likely have been
used in 20 conflicts, by 11 governments and 30 rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 138 governments and ratified by
101. Among those who have not signed are the United States, Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Washington maintains land mines are needed on the Korean
peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea. President
Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but
only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China say they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Antipersonnel mines have been used in eight conflicts in Africa
over the past year, more than any other continent, Landmine Monitor
said. They killed or maimed more than 1,000 people in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Colombia, where the two biggest rebel factions
have used land mines, is the only country in the Americas where
they are now being used.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, mines were used in at least six conflicts over the past
year -- among them in Kashmir and the Philippines where, the study
said, three rebel groups have used mines or improvised explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Government forces and at least 10 armed ethnic groups in Myanmar
laid mines ''in significant numbers'' -- resulting in 1,500 mine
victims last year -- while both sides used them in Sri Lanka's civil
war, it added.
