France and Germany turn in ratification for land mine ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N.
officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning
anti-personnel land mines.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet and the deputy German
representative, Gerhard Walter Henze, turned in the so-called
instruments of ratification, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be
ratified by 40 countries to take effect. So far 25 countries have
ratified it.
	   ``Nevertheless, the goal remains to ban anti-personnel mines at
a global level,'' the German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel said in
a statement. ``I therefore call once more on those states who have
not yet acceded to the convention to do so as soon as possible.''
	   In a related matter, Malaysia became the 150th country to sign
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Eckhard said.
