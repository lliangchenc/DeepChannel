   BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. _ Mary Ogelsby is more motivated this summer
in a drama class at the Blue Springs Fine Arts Academy than during
the school year in any academic class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love music, and I love theater,'' said Mary, a Blue Springs
High School sophomore who wants to be a drama instructor. ``If I
didn't have a chance to do music or theater, I just don't think I
would do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students in Missouri, Kansas and across the country
share Mary's need for artistic expression. Some say they might drop
out if not for the arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those students are riding a national wave of encouragement that
has spurred the growth of programs like the Blue Springs Academy.
Also fueling the movement, recent brain research shows that some
children learn in ways other than the traditional three R's.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, fine-arts academies for middle and high school
students have sprouted in the past four years in Springfield,
Independence and Blue Springs. In the Kansas City district, magnet
programs for the arts are highly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in Kansas said more money is going to train teachers
to expand music, theater and visual-arts programs by using existing
art in the community. And teachers are being taught to blend the
arts into core subjects such as English, science, history and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at meeting the needs of all students, the
academically proficient and the artistically gifted,'' said Dee
Hansen, fine-arts specialist at the Kansas Department of Education.
``The more we learn about how we learn, the more it validates fine
arts as an integral part of the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, arts academies are funded like other summer
programs _ through state reimbursement for attendance. Also,
philanthropic foundations contribute toward field trips and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Springs Academy, in its first year, receives support
from the Truman Heartland Community Foundation and offers theater,
visual arts, vocal instruction, videography and creative writing.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 students attend the academy, which was modeled after
the nationally recognized George Caleb Bingham Fine Arts Academy in
the Independence district.
</P>
<P>
   The Bingham Academy, in its third year, offers a five-week
program for five disciplines: creative writing, dance, instrumental
and vocal music, theater and visual arts. Students can get one-half
credit for high school and three hours of credit through Blue River
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new experience for me, and I really love it,'' said
Kiley Smith, a Truman High School junior studying visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled on the classroom floor, Kiley worked on a drawing of a
mysterious-looking woman wearing a black midriff that showed her
navel through a sheer black shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley said the academy offers more freedom than art classes
during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students here work at their level, and they get to do their
own thing,'' explained Tom Creamer, Bingham's instructor. ``They
don't have to follow a structured classroom curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, students from the Blue Springs and Bingham
academies visit local museums, galleries and theaters. This year
the Bingham students also will spend a week studying the cultural
arts in Santa Fe, N.M. Both academies are free.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 4-year-old state Fine Arts Academy in Springfield, the
Bingham Academy selects students based on portfolios and auditions.
This year, 80 students attend. They spend four hours a day in
class, Monday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The local focus on arts responds to a national objective
announced by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1998 to put
high-quality arts education in all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though no federal law mandates the teaching of fine arts, in
1994 an objective of improving fine-arts instruction was added to
the U.S. Department of Education's Goals for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That ``confirmed the nation's commitment to having students
educated in the arts and made grant money available to develop art
programs and to train teachers,'' said Melinda Malico, a
spokeswoman with the department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a sampling of 6,600 eighth-grade students from across
the country was tested for knowledge of the arts. That assessment,
said Education Secretary Richard Riley, indicated that the nation
was falling short in artistic instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arts education is an essential part of strengthening academic
achievement, creating strong schools and building a culture of
learning,'' Riley said.
