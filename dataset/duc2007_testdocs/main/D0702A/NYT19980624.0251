 LOS ANGELES: other schools.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts
education have begun to change. Buoyed by a revived economy,
California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put
education on the front burner. And arts education has crept back
onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great demand for talented visual artists, but
unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the
U.S.,'' said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James
Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction,
has called for the restoration of arts education in California
public schools. And last March the Los Angeles school district
passed stringent graduation requirements citywide in visual arts,
music, theater and dance, for kindergarten through grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part now is the implementation,'' said Don Dustin,
the district's director of visual and performing arts. ``We do not
have the resources, the background, the personnel.'' Inner City
Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, does.
</P>
<P>
   After the construction of Inner City Arts, Maltzan designed a
new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a
private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood. It
is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and
art gallery. Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a
much-used communal plaza. Enrollment in art classes has increased
since the recent opening.
</P>
<P>
   While Inner City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less
likely to be an architectural one. Because many public schools are
struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned,
concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Inner City Arts and Harvard-Westlake, Maltzan initially
faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture. At Inner
City Arts, he said, ``they were used to living off donated paper.''
At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers
paramount and architecture as enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees,'' said
Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, ``architecture
implies added expense. It's not until someone catches the contagion
of creativity and inspiration of architecture that one appreciates
what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools.
Perhaps architecture will follow.
