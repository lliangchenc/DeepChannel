<HEADLINE> Schools to Have More, Better Teaching Equipment </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle schools
across China will be equipped with more and better educational
instruments as part of the drive toward higher-quality education.
</P>
<P>
Linguistic labs, computer labs, and specialized classrooms for
other practical skills will be created in these schools, along
with libraries and facilities for music, the arts, and physical
education.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has required localities to further
increase investment in educational technologies, and to guarantee
that the investment grows annually.
</P>
<P>
The bulk buying of educational equipment in areas where
conditions are ripe should be done by public bidding, in order to
set up a sound operational and monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also has asked localities to map out plans for
modern educational technology outfitting and to strengthen
administration.
</P>
<P>
A large gap remains in the level of modern educational material
between large- and medium-sized cities and many rural areas in
China. Computers, the Internet, and multi-media education have
become standard components of school life for many primary and
middle school students in major cities such as Beijing and
Shanghai. Students in poorer areas, however, may still be doing
their homework bending over an earthen bed in the dim light of a
kerosene lamp.
