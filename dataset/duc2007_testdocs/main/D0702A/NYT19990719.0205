   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dear Gov. Gray Davis:
</P>
<P>
   Because you said you wanted to be ``the education governor'' of
California, I am writing to you on behalf of some 50,000 San
Francisco school children in grades kindergarten through nine.
</P>
<P>
   Could you and your pals in Sacramento please knock off the
finger pointing long enough to see that you are punishing a whole
lot of kids down here because a handful of adults once made some
questionable choices?
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, at about 4:45 a.m. _ yes, a.m. _ the San Francisco
Board of Education unanimously but miserably approved a
substantially shrunken $533 million budget for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from that sum was the money to pay for _ surprise, surprise
_ what little remained of this city's elementary school arts
programs ($650,000). Gone too was the money to pay for an extended
day, or seventh period, for middle school students ($4.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   That extra hour may not seem like such a loss, but when you
raise academic standards for graduation _ as San Francisco Unified
School District did awhile back _ it makes a huge difference for
thousands of kids who need all the learning time they can get.
</P>
<P>
   As for the arts programs, how can we pretend to be an advanced,
let alone civilized, society and keep treating art and music as if
they are luxurious fluff? Worse, how can we continue to do this
during the flushest economic times in the history of the state?
</P>
<P>
   As school board member Jill Wynns said after the pre-dawn budget
vote: ``The state is drowning in tax money, and we're cutting core,
essential programs in San Francisco. We hate this budget. But we
had no choice, no options.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, governor, I know you many not think much of anybody who
sits on the San Francisco board. A few of your recent vetoes stand
as monuments to your disappointment. Those vetoes _ worth millions
to San Francisco Unified _ gave the board little choice but to cut
the seventh period and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets us back to the bodies on the bottom of this pile: the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't their fault that San Francisco, like a lot of
California urban school districts, financed for years some
expansion projects and academic upgrades by sort of borrowing
against the bucks they were accustomed to getting _ sooner or later
_ from the feds and state for desegregation programs.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the kids' fault that San Francisco's former
superintendent, Bill Rojas, performed this perfectly legal but
risky financial jukestep longer and more spiritedly than any other
superintendent, or that his cash-strapped board juked along so
docilely.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it the kids' fault that Rojas' in-yo'-face,
gimme-the-bleeping-money style offended your predecessor, Pete
Wilson, half the Capitol and _ until he left for Dallas _ you.
</P>
<P>
   I've read enough to turn my eyeballs bloody about this stuff:
The overuse of the desegregation money; the Legislature's
retroactive rescission of California's share of the dough; your
vetoes of the Legislature's attempts to put back all or some of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   What a mess. Some people say the state OK'd and promised that
money to the schools and, by law, ought to pay up; some say new
laws supersede that. No doubt you will all spend the next 18 months
arguing about it, and many lawyers will get rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawyers argue about the desegregation millions, guess
what will happen to the kids? They'll get the royal shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Although it amounts to a measly half-hour of instruction per
week for only about half the kids, San Francisco still has a shred
of a public grammar school music program. Do you know why? It isn't
thanks to the state. A one-time windfall blew into the city's
budget several years ago, was allocated for public school music
programs and got locked into the protective arms of Proposition J,
the Children's Amendment. It was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Governor, in your heart, that fact must strike you as shameful,
especially in a state whose legislators are contorting themselves
trying to find ways to ``give back'' a great budget surplus. Music
by fluke?
</P>
<P>
   Logic dictates that the more time a junior high kid spends in
class, the better chance she or he has to improve learning skills.
And numerous studies have proved that visual and musical arts
programs increase a child's overall learning ability and make for
better, healthier socialization.
</P>
<P>
   Please, governor, your vetoes show you have the power. Your
political record shows you know how to make things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Reimburse the desegregation funds or tap some other source.
Don't punish the kids. Find a way to do the right thing for them.
</P>
