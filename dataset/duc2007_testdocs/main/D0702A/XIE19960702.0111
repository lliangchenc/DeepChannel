ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Every weekend, students in
Zhengzhou can take in a free concert, a traditional Chinese opera
or a stage play in the city's Youth and Children's Palace, as part
of a project to improve the younger generation's education in the
arts.
</P>
<P>
The project was launched by the city government three months
ago for students in local colleges, middle and primary
schools. Zhengzhou is the capital city of central China's Henan
Province.

<P>
One concert featured the Henan Philharmonic Orchestra playing
works by Beethoven, Chopin and Bizet. During the evening, the
young listeners were told how the different instruments work,
given information about each composer and taught how to appreciate
a symphony.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of these activities hope that by providing young
people access to classical music and opera, and dramatic works,
they will turn away from the influence of vulgar art performances.
</P>
<P>
The "music and drama" weekends have also helped nurture
civilized manners and moral conduct in young people, sources
said.
