<P>
   Whenever she is cooking dinner or taking her sons, Jack, 41/2,
and Zach, 20 months, on short car trips, Dallas resident Shaun
Mayner plays classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Mayner grew up in the '60s and was raised on rock 'n' roll, but
she wholeheartedly believes that classical music is good for her
kids _ in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced there's something there _ I know it directly
affects their behavior,'' she says. ``Classical music is very
organized, and that structure _ whether it's fast or slow and
relaxed _ affects their mood and how they act.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she says, when the music's on in the car, her
kids begin to notice the outside world. Jack starts a two-way
conversation with her instead of issuing a series of ``I want'' or
``I need'' demands, she says. And both children are drawn to the
kitchen when Mayner turns on the classical music _ otherwise, she
says, they tend to stay in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just mood that Mayner, and many other parents, are
concerned with. She is one of thousands of Americans who believe in
the ``Mozart effect,'' a theory that classical music can affect the
learning capabilities of children 3 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect
on anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose
minds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of
California-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in
child development, bringing with it several popular parenting books
and an onslaught of CDs _ all aimed at directing American parents
toward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula
for effective parenting.
</P>
<P>
   But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or
helpful?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the
theory behind the Mozart effect. The most well-known is Dr. John
Bruer, president of St. Louis' McDonnell Foundation. In ``The Myth
of the First Three Years,'' which will be published Sept. 9 by Free
Press (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis
has been placed on brain development in the first three years of
life.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims
that listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial
reasoning skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Steele agrees. A psychology professor at North
Carolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart
effect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the
California studies don't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even
include young children _ they were performed on college students,
who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a
specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and
cutting a piece of paper. This is, he says, hardly a measure of any
sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there
was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects
who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern
composer Philip Glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were
published in July in ``Psychological Science.'' ``These students
were equivalent across the board; their performance was the same.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the
minority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical
CDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart.'' Three of the 15 top-selling
classical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the
author whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon
hardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe
in the effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, Florida toddlers now listen to classical
music in public schools _ by law. The National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences handed out free CDs of classical Grammy winners
this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.
Californian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical
music helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for
complex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of
classical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep
With Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide. ``I am
convinced. I believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as
people's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.
The whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to
do something good for their children. Parents who play their kids
the music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that
they're helping their child's development.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too,
Steele says with a laugh. It all comes down to the money. Babies
will always be born to proud, new parents who want to do what's
best _ which means that classical albums for kids may be major cash
cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of commercial interest here,'' Steele says. ``A
lot of companies see it as a way to sell a lot of CDs very fast.''
