   NEW YORK _ They applauded Philip Glass as if he were a rap star
and greeted the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with a
gasp of delighted recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Hall audience the other day was composed of
hundreds of students in grades four through six from schools around
the city. Most had participated in Carnegie Hall's Linkup music
education program, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being
slashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the
country. But how much the students actually learned was measured
largely through anecdotes until now.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall tried to improve on this with help from Columbia
University's Teachers College and Educational Testing Services.
Program administrators asked 6,000 students participating in the
program to develop musical compositions at the beginning of the
course and again at the end. The students used commercially
available glockenspiels and homemade thumb pianos, guitars made of
cardboard, a set of three can drums, can shakers and trumpets made
from garden hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complicated scoring formula, testers evaluated the
differences between the two compositions. The improvement was far
from earthshaking, but evaluators concluded that it was
``significant'' given the modest length of the program, which ran
for seven 45-minute sessions. The final compositions showed small
improvements in how students produced sounds and alternated
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   And in written responses to questions about composing, the
students gave more detailed explanations of how they used the
instruments to create action, character and mood.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study were released this month. ``I was very
pleased with the modest gains,''said Carol Myford, a senior
research scientist at Educational Testing Services in Princeton,
N.J. ``This is a short-term program.''
</P>
<P>
   Linkup emphasizes basic music concepts and music's relationships
to other academic subjects through classes, planning sessions for
teachers and artists, and concerts in schools and neighborhoods.
This year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733
teachers at 176 schools in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, conducted in the 1996-97 school year, students
working in groups of six were given a set of instruments and asked
to write a piece of music that would illustrate a short story they
were asked to read. Then they were asked, after some instruction in
how to use the instruments, to choose sounds that ``show''
characters, action and mood.
</P>
<P>
   The students had 15 minutes to create and practice a piece that
was a minute or two long. Each group played its piece, which was
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was repeated at the end of the program, and the
compositions were taped again. The students' efforts were evaluated
for use of timbre, texture, portrayal of the text and overall
effectiveness. The students also responded to written questions on
work sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that sixth graders made the greatest gains while
fourth graders made the smallest. The report hypothesized that
older students had had more exposure to the concepts of text,
timbre and texture. Another hypothesis was that the curriculum was
more appropriate for older students.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, students showed the most improvement in their use of
texture and the smallest gain in their exploration of timbre.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the
Harvard University Graduate School of Education, whose theories of
multiple intelligences have gained wide popularity, said that the
study sounded like a positive step but that follow-up was needed.
It is important to determine whether the students continue to
improve, after such a short program, and at what rate, Gardner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That you can do something in a short time is worth noting,''
he added. ``It's a good message to kids that this is something you
can get better at.''
