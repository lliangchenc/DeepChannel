<HEADLINE> Clinton Laments School Music Cuts  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday that ''it was
tragic'' that school music programs frequently are the easiest
target when budget-minded administrators have to cut education
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been very disturbed'' about the problem, the president
said. ''Over the last 20 years, more and more as schools have come
under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show in tandem with the ''Save the
Music'' fund-raising drive by music channel VH1 to preserve music
programs in schools across America. By some estimates, only 25
percent of American schools offer music programs as a basic part of
the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was broadcast from a public elementary school in
East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president was visiting an elementary school in Queens
to underscore the need for new school construction and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a saxophone player who played in his high school
band, has long championed the cause of preserving music programs in
schools. He said he volunteered to get involved when he heard about
the VH1 program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that a lot of our young children learn better if they
have access to music education,'' Clinton said. ''Not everyone
learns in the same way, not everyone's brain is stimulated in the
same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to
have higher academic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the federal government should do more to ease the
financial strain on schools by providing more money to hire new
teachers and build more classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was important that parents raise their voices and
demand music programs for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just
took the music programs for granted,'' Clinton said. 'A lot of
people who were making tough budget decisions assumed nobody would
care if they were eliminated. And it was tragic, what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ''You'll see a big infusion of public money going
back into these programs because of what VH1 has done and because
more and more parents will insist on the music being there. And
I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was up early for the interview after spending the night
at his home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his New York visit, he was to speak at an evening
fund raiser for Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y. The president was
scheduled to stay in New York Friday night and return home on
Saturday.
