   HAVANA, Cuba _ The Milwaukee Symphony's recent mission to this
city looked different to different people. Was it a gift of musical
culture to the Cuban people? Well, Cuba has its own symphony
orchestras, and the players I came across were good indeed: lots of
technique, lots of style.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if we close our eyes and imagine a colonial superpower
steaming across the Gulf of Mexico, bent on reinforcing a stranded
enclave of classical music, then the trip makes more sense. The
word ``colonial'' is big in Cuba, defining the island's long
history of occupation and exploitation. And classical music in Cuba
could, from this point of view, use a little rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived Cubans not only of
heavy machinery and export credits but also of a link to Central
and East European musical tradition. Czech and Soviet teachers came
here to teach; Cubans went to them to study. Music education is big
in Cuban schools, but the instruments are 30 years old and in
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Milwaukee concerts in Havana, the closest thing to an
American orchestra visiting here was a youth ensemble from New
England a year or so ago. So complex is the ritual of cultural
exchange that it has generated a whole new industry, namely
Canada-Cuba Sports and Cultural Festivals, with offices in Toronto
and Havana. This is not a sideline enterprise; it is based on Cuba
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have an easier time of it here: officially friends,
not enemies. Jonathan Watts, president of the company, reports that
officials here are no harder to deal with than any others but that
telephones and telecommunications are in bad shape. Canada-Cuba has
responded by building its own private network of phones, faxes and
e-mail, and hiring people here to run its office.
</P>
<P>
   Arts exchanges are only part of the business. The University of
Colorado sends archaeologists; the University of Wisconsin, nurses
and nursing know-how. Watts' worst Cuban-American experience was
the recent visit of the Baltimore Orioles. ``They tried to
politicize everything,'' he said. ``There was arguing whether Fidel
Castro would get the proceeds of the gates at baseball games. The
tickets were either free or cost 5 cents. This added up to about
$50.''
</P>
<P>
   One more way to describe Milwaukee in Havana is this: picture an
American orchestra with Liszt and Strauss as its imports and set it
against the much larger picture of musical Cuba as a whole. Anyone
who has succumbed to ``The Buena Vista Social Club'' _ either the
movie or the recording _ has to wonder whether we shouldn't be
listening to the Cuban popular tradition rather than Bernsteinian
syntheses of it in ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the classical European tradition arriving by way of North
America is a marginal affectation. A more paranoid Cuban might find
here the latest colonialist plot to impose the will of foreigners
on local sensibilities. The divide between cultures is more vivid
in Cuba, given its recent isolation and its ethnic core heavily
based on the black slave population sent long ago to work the
country's lucrative sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   Europe came to this island, and the genetic memory of that
coming survives. And, of course, any ``native'' music, with a
little historical digging, can be shredded into many musics, all of
them originally from somewhere else. But in the drums, bongos,
claves and maracas that underlie the Cuban music that one hears
performed in nearly every bar, restaurant and cafe, there is
something distinctive. The distance to Spain and Britain seems far,
and to Africa just a brief hop.
</P>
<P>
   Whose music is whose becomes more complicated in the United
States. German, Hungarian and Polish immigrants in the 19th century
didn't import classical music; they brought it with them. Maybe
European music has as much a proprietary claim to original
Americanness as the country's own black tradition. Or is the real
America in sound the beating drums and ritual whoops of Iroquois
and Sioux?
</P>
<P>
   The last argument may be in trouble. Recent anthropological
musings suggest that some form of Caucasian may have beat the
Indian to America after all, a possibility that sits uneasily with
tribal lawyers suing for the return of, or compensation for,
confiscated lands. For who knows from whom, if anybody, tribes got
their territory in the first place? Did some prehistoric Bach once
sound through the canyons of New Mexico? To anyone interested in
the question of aborigine and interloper, I suggest ``The Enigma of
Arrival'' by V.S. Naipul.
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions can be argued in the public spaces of Havana,
all teeming with live popular music. Trios and quartets of
guitarists and singers seem to go with every place that sells a
drink or food to eat. My bus passed by a big curbside band
including oboes and a cello; I wish I had heard them play. Next to
the gritty intricacy of ``The Buena Vista Social Club,'' most of
these musicians seem bland. Rhythmic complication is smoothed out;
the rough edges of singing style are sandpapered clean. But the
basic impulses of Cuban music are there to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Symphony did have its grateful audience of
conservatory students, older music lovers and children, but with
the incessant hum of another music all around it, the image of a
small and isolated enclave was not far off. Liszt and Strauss
played by a major orchestra made a nice change, but the next
important music of this world may arrive not by way of New York or
Vienna concert halls but from the streets of Latin America.(BOX)
