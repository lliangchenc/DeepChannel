<HEADLINE> Arts May Improve Students' Grade </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If your teen-agers want to be in the high  
school band or drama club, let them. It may improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
	High school students who take music lessons and join theater  
groups do better in math, reading, history, geography and 
citizenship, according to a study of Education Department data to 
be published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If young Americans are to succeed and to contribute to what  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan describes as our 'economy 
of ideas,' they will need an education that develops imaginative, 
flexible and tough-minded thinking,'' Education Secretary Richard 
Riley said in a message accompanying the study. ``The arts 
powerfully nurture the ability to think in this manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which tracked more than 25,000 students for more than  
10 years, found that students who reported consistently high levels 
of involvement with instrumental music scored significantly higher 
on math tests by the 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	This observation held true for students regardless of their  
parents' income, occupations and levels of education, said James S. 
Catterall, the lead author and an education professor at the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	While 38.6 percent of higher-income students who were uninvolved  
in music scored high in math, 48 percent of those highly interested 
in music received the high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids who are more advantaged tend to be more involved in the  
arts. Period. They have more opportunities and you'd expect them to 
do better,'' Catterall said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But the influence of music was far more pronounced among  
lower-income students. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lower-income students without music involvement, only  
15.5 percent achieved high math scores. But of the musically 
oriented group, more than twice as many excelled in math. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of economic advantage. It's a matter of  
something happening with the arts for the kids,'' Catterall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that as students progress through high  
school they are less likely to be involved in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a clear trend,'' Catterall said. ``Kids participation  
in the arts declines. It may be that high schools offer fewer 
programs than middle schools or that kids are more concerned with 
academics or admissions to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 3 percent of seniors take out-of-school classes in  
music, art or dance, compared with more than 11 percent of 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the ``high-involvement'' seniors are found in  
top levels on standardized tests, compared with fewer than 43 
percent of the ``low-involvement'' seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also indicated arts study affected students' racial  
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students at grade 10 were asked if it was OK to make a racist  
remark,'' the authors wrote. ``About 40 percent 'no-drama' students 
felt that making such a remark would be OK, where only about 12 
percent of high theater students thought the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the 12th graders involved in plays were compared to their  
uninvolved counterparts, 20 percent more of those active in drama 
had excellent reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Catterall noted that the work supports strong suggestions, but  
is not definitive. 
</P>
<P>
	This study was one of seven included in ``Champions of Change --  
The Impact of the Arts on Learning,'' by Edward B. Fiske, former 
education editor of The New York Times. The project was sponsored 
by the GE (General Electric) Fund and the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation.
