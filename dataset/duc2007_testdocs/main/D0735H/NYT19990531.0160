   Timber wolves from Canada are unlikely to recolonize the
northeastern United States on their own, leaving the politically
more contentious course of deliberate reintroduction as the best
strategy for restoring the wild wolf's howl to the region, a new
study sponsored by New York's Wildlife Conservation Society has
found.
</P>
<P>
   While there are corridors of natural habitat through which
wolves from southern Quebec might move into Maine, the study found,
many barriers inhibit their passage, most importantly legal hunting
and trapping, which have long been a way of life in that region of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty intense gantlet they would have to run'' to
survive in numbers sufficient to establish a permanent population
in the United States, said Dr. William Weber of the Wildlife
Conservation Society, formerly the New York Zoological Society.
Weber was one of four authors of the study, which appears in the
current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin, a scientific
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a few lone wolves were to succeed in filtering into the
northeastern states, the study found, they might well mate with the
region's abundant coyotes. This could create a hybrid population in
which the wolf gene pool would eventually be swamped, defeating the
very purpose of recolonization. Artificially reintroducing intact
wolf packs might overcome that difficulty, some scientists believe,
since packs tend to kill coyotes rather than breed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation organizations, led by the Washington-based
Defenders of Wildlife, have been pressing for the re-establishment
of timber wolves in northern New England or the Adirondacks or
both, where they were once plentiful but have been extinct for
about a century.
</P>
<P>
   The new study ``says what we have felt all along, that natural
colonization probably isn't highly likely,'' said Nina Fascione,
the director of species conservation for the Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Although wolves are plentiful in Canada and Alaska, several
species of them have long been legally protected as endangered or
threatened in the contiguous 48 states, where populations numbering
in the thousands were hunted to the verge of extinction, or beyond,
well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, gray wolves are on the rebound in two former American
strongholds, the Northern Rockies and the upper Great Lakes. More
than 30 packs totaling 400 to 500 wolves now inhabit large areas of
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, mostly because wolves artificially
introduced from western Canada in 1995 and 1996 have rapidly
reproduced. Some 2,500 wolves now live in Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Michigan, where they always lived.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwestern and Western wolves are doing so well, in fact,
that federal officials plan to remove the Great Lakes population
from the protected list soon and hope they will be able to follow
with the newly re-established Northern Rockies population in two or
three years. The Mexican wolf is also being restored to the
Southwest, albeit with much difficulty, and the red wolf has been
re-established in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these efforts, according to the new study and
others, the wolf population of the United States outside Alaska has
doubled and the wolf's range has nearly tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal officials are turning their attention to the
Northeast. After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the
Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for
public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in
the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads
the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass.
All recovery options will be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of conserving biological diversity, the
basic rationale for re-establishing wolves in the Northeast could
be strengthened by recent genetic studies by Canadian scientists.
Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of
eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long
considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species
and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of wolf recovery say that restoring wolves would help
to re-establish natural ecological relationships long sundered in
the Northeast. For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too
big for coyotes. Moose have flourished in northern New England,
both because there are no predators and because logging has created
ideal second-growth habitat for them.

   Wolves, which along with cougars were historically the region's
top predators, might restore some natural equilibrium with moose,
say the advocates, just as they might help control runaway deer and
beaver populations. In addition, the carcasses of animals killed by
wolves provide food for scavengers that are essential elements of a
complete ecosystem. Moreover, wolves have acquired a certain
cachet, as their new popularity in Yellowstone testifies, and
proponents say they bring in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, as they did in the West, argue that wolves would
prey on livestock. There have been some attacks in the West, and
owners of the livestock have been compensated from a special fund
set up by the Defenders of Wildlife. In Idaho and around
Yellowstone, owners are allowed under federal rules to shoot wolves
they see attacking livestock, and some have been legally killed.
Some opponents also fear that wolves might attack people, but
experts on wolves say that they strongly fear humans and avoid
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding
between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the
success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. Her organization,
which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf
restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society,
in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from
Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place.
It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the
area needed to sustain a wolf population. If wolves were put into
the Adirondacks, Weber said in a recent interview, they would
probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet
than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for
providing sufficiently extensive habitat. It also identified two
possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could
disperse from Quebec into Maine. The authors of that study said,
however, that further investigation would be required to determine
whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found that highways, railroads and the St.
Lawrence River posed formidable barriers across these corridors. It
also concluded that intensive hunting and snaring, coupled with
negative attitudes toward wolves, would further inhibit their
spread. Moreover, the study found, hunting and trapping had reduced
the wolf population of southern Quebec enough to lessen the
pressure on wolves to migrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said that natural colonization remained a
possibility if Canada and the United States worked together to
protect wolves in the dispersal corridors. It also noted that any
reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would
require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably
spread into New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any restoration in New England has to be done with binational
cooperation,'' Ms. Fascione said.
