<HEADLINE> Gray Wolf Makes Remarkable Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government proposed Tuesday to reduce
federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had
successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more
could die as a result of the change.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the
wolves -- all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest --
as threatened rather than endangered. That means authorities would
have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into
account concerns from private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced
to parts of New Mexico and Arizona -- only 22 wolves -- would remain
endangered because they continue to be under the threat of
extinction, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf -- also known as the
timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered
species success story.'' But she said the increase in the number of
wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet
the needs of the species and those of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection,
the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as
''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand
into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf
experts said. Those include vast areas of the West and even parts
of New England, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the less restrictive designation might convince
landowners in the Northeast -- where currently there are no wolves
known to exist, despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept
future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But as threatened -- a less protective designation under the
federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured
or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less
restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan.
</P>
<P>
   The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout
the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota -- where it has a
''threatened'' classification.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the
northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the
northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in
Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today
there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in
Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The reintroduction
of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in
Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made the right choice to ... bring these animals back from
the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant
reclassification.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups
with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the
lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's
range.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of
Defenders of Wildlife. He said he wasn't opposed to the
reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not
considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could
lose federal protection entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal
''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far
short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would
establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary
ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection
in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
