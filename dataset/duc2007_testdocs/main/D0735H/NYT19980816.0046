GRAY WOLF LOSES IN TEST OF NATURAL SELECTION

<P>
   You might have read last week about an endangered Mexican gray
wolf that was found dead in the White Mountains near the carcass of
an elk calf.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to
Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. Unfortunately, this
small female was the mother of the only pup born in the wild that
still was there.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists may try to provide food for the motherless pup and
attempt to keep it in the wild. An alternative would be to capture
it and raise it in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Another wolf was shot by a camper, who said he killed the animal
after it attacked his dog. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service won't
prosecute the camper.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of the female wolf seems more compelling because
it apparently happened during a conflict with another predator _
namely a mountain lion, perhaps the most formidable killer in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But before the confrontation could be figured out completely,
federal agents had to determine whether a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death
was treated as a crime scene. It's against the law to kill a member
of an endangered species. The wolf's remains were sent to experts
for examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chunk of its side was ripped out, which could have been
consistent with being shot with a high-powered rifle,'' said  &UR; John
 &UR; Phelps, furbearer specialist for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department. ``That was the first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps
said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and
was challenged by the wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pack of wolves can challenge a lion,'' he said, ``but
usually an individual wolf wouldn't do that _ especially a small
female like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should have been, but taking out this wolf was no
easy task for the lion, according to Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole hillside was torn up,'' he said. ``There apparently
was a pretty good fight. Usually, a lion will grab the back of the
neck and break it or grab the throat and suffocate when it attacks.
This was a small wolf, but it put up a good fight. This was not
typical of a lion kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wolves have shown signs of their inexperience in the
wild. There have been reports that some have shown little fear of
humans. There was speculation that the dead wolf, probably having
never encountered a lion, didn't know how formidable this foe would
be.
</P>
<P>
   But she obviously was aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of wolf you'd like out there (if the species
is going to re-establish itself),'' Phelps said. ``It's too bad she
had to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just too aggressive.'' &QL; 
Information growing &QL; 
In the next few weeks, Game and Fish should have available on its
Internet site a unit-by-unit breakdown of hunting information on
both small and big game, according to  &UR; Bob Miles, a public
information officer for the department who is organizing the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Only bison will be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be compiled from the reports of wildlife
managers in the various units, who work the field in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   There will be reports on quail and other small game plus reports
on big-game populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an attempt to tell hunters which rocks to hunt
under,'' Miles said. ``But it will be an overview with specific
information on each unit. It will give them a general place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a tremendous help to hunters _ especially for
small-game stuff. It will be more basic for big game. But it will
give good access information.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles, who once worked in the Tucson region, said a similar
Internet page was developed there and became the most popular part
of the region's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The information also will be available in hard copy at Game and
Fish's regional offices free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Target date is about Sept. 1. &QL;
