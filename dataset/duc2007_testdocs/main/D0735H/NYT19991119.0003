   LOS ANGELES -- Robert Smith led the leashed gray wolf Tatonka
toward 50 nervous students Thursday at Van Nuys High School, where
the mascot is a wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow-eyed, 125-pound canine can exert three times more jaw
pressure than a German shepherd, enough to rip a human arm off,
warned Smith, ranch manager for Wolves -N- Wildlife, a Fillmore
educational group.
</P>
<P>
   For a few tense moments, the teen-agers sat silently, not
knowing what to expect next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how cute,'' 17-year-old junior Anush Artenyan said
finally, breaking the silence and bringing smiles to her
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brought the 1{-year-old wolf to school to show the
students wolves are one of the world's most misunderstood animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach kids the wolf is not the evil animal in `Little Red
Riding Hood,''' Smith said. `It's actually a gentle animal that
will not hunt you down. It's not the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Tatonka was raised in captivity and is used to being
around humans.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Champion, executive director of Mercy Crusade, Inc., a
Thousand Oaks-based animal humane organization that sponsored the
event, said she hopes the students understand the importance of
protecting endangered wildlife like wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids will never get to see a real wolf,'' she
said. ``Being the school is the home of the Wolves, this was
perfect. The school is now interested in adopting this wolf as its
mascot.''
</P>
<P>
   For student 17-year-old student Alisa Akilyan, the experience
with the wolf was a memorable one, but she wanted to get closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes attracted me from far away,'' she said. ``When I saw
the wolf, I noticed he wouldn't attack people. I could tell he was
kind so I didn't get scared. I wish I could have touched him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolves -N- Wildlife is an educational wildlife group located on
a 120-acre ranch in Fillmore, also home to nine other wolves, a
Siberian tiger and a black bear.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, wolves ranged all over the United States in large
numbers, but traps and poison made them virtually extinct by 1930,
he said. In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species
list. Since then, wolves have been reintroduced in some western
states and now number about 5,000, Smith said. &QL;
