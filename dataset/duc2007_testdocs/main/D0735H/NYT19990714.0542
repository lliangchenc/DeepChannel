`NEW WOLVES' NOT EXACTLY DANCING

   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it's just the ``w'' word _ wolves.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction of the nearly extinct Mexican wolf into the
American Southwest has initiated an emotional argument that seems
to go way beyond the paltry numbers involved. The wolf is a
creature able to stir passion; the species has such a dark hold of
human imagination that rational debate may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bass has entered the circle with the credentials to be
fair. The Texas native _ from deep in the heart of often-militant
opposition to wolves _ is a conservationist and a hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The author has set the ambitious goal of being both journalistic
and literary in ``The New Wolves'' (Lyons; $18.95). He has made his
166-page book readable and enlightening, though a few lapses weaken
the vivid picture he has painted.
</P>
<P>
   Bass does a good job of setting up the situation before the
return of Mexican wolves to Eastern Arizona's Blue Range: The
slaughter of the wolf and other predators paralleled the killing of
bison and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Bass introduces biologists and volunteers inspired by the idea
of reintroduction, interviews a ranching couple who favor holistic
management, making no attempt to kill predators, and a gadfly who
believes the program is doomed to failure, another example of
questionable government planning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere does Bass interview the ranchers who would just as
soon kill the wolves on sight because they pose a threat to
livestock on the parched and often overgrazed land. Bass does note
that each rancher losing any of his herd will be compensated and
that the losses would surely be minimal. He is sympathetic to the
wolves' plight; however, the views of detractors whose voices must
be heard in an open-minded forum are nowhere in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the author shows a delicate touch. Describing the
release of the wolves into the wild, he writes, ``Their eyes carry
more than ours do.'' He provides fine profiles of the beasts and
their territories. But he falls into the role of a mystic, and it
can be grating.
</P>
<P>
   He gets so carried away that he resorts to extravagant metaphors
that are unnecessarily intrusive: ``Do the increases in rumors
reflect that the wolves are already there, or do the increases in
rumor compress to a point of saturation, a density of desire in the
air, that is finally sufficient to lure and welcome wolves back
into that land, as a weather system rolls from a high-pressure area
into a low, or as the tides follow the moon and the Earth?''
</P>
<P>
   Come on.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bass has sketched the basic details of the story
and there's a lot of good writing. But readers will find the book
not a meal but an appetizer. A wolf would need more. Our rating: HH

   If ever there were a true recreational mecca, Colorado's Rocky
Mountains fit the bill. For a memorable trip to the ``backbone of
the world'' without many on-trail Sig Alerts, two titles could
steer you in the right direction:
</P>
<P>
   Different problems limit the appeal of Gerry Roach's
``Colorado's Indian Peaks: Classic Hikes and Climbs'' (Fulcrum;
$16.95). Triathlon types will be the main audience. Weekend
warriors better stay at home; there are no hikes for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder, Colo., author is a world-class mountaineer who has
climbed Mount Everest and was only the second climber to scale the
highest peak on every continent. He has climbed all of Colorado's
14,000-plus-feet pinnacles and displays an expert knowledge of the
region described in the 180-page no-nonsense guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   The topographic maps are good and directions concise for the 21
trailheads, 29 hikes, 49 peaks and 127 routes. But there's another
number _ one, as in (begin ital)the(end ital) big question: What is
special about this region? The mediocre black-and-white photos
certainly don't show it. A couple of descriptive pages _ not
flowery, but informative _ would be helpful. Every area is unique
in some way; if not, why travel so far to get there? Our rating: HH
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Valerio has compiled a list of the best outdoor
businesses in ``Top Rated Rocky Mountain Adventures''
(Picked-By-You Guides; $18.95). Ratings are based on service,
knowledge and performance. Categories include big-game and bird
hunting, fly-fishing and other angling, wilderness adventures and
whitewater trips.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some major gaps in the 278 pages. The author has
failed to include any price information; these kinds of trips could
be fabulous, and fabulously expensive. Maps are also inadequate.
