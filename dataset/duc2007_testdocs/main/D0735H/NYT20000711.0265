GRAY WOLF MAY BE HEADED OFF THE ENDANGERED LIST

   Calling it a success story on a par with the comeback of the
bald eagle, federal wildlife officials announced Tuesday that the
gray wolf, hunted nearly to extinction a century ago, has rebounded
enough to no longer be considered an endangered species in most of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been
stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when
the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one
killed. By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there
were only a few hundred left.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight
states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to
ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the
federal Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for
things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing
the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in
the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all
federal protection in 30 states. Endangered species get more legal
protection than threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are
so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and
environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves
to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   However, some federal officials believe reduced protections for
wolves may actually improve prospects for reintroducing them here
by easing private land owners' fears that the wolf's arrival would
trigger serious limits on the use of their land.
</P>
<P>
   But activists who have been pushing to bring the wolf back to
the Northeast rejected that logic. They called Babbitt's plan to
``downlist'' protections for wolves a concession to the ranchers,
sheep farmers and land owners who see wolves as a hazard to their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the wolves from endangered to threatened ``is a purely
political move with no biological basis whatsoever,'' said Michael
Kellett, executive director of Restore the North Woods, which
supports reintroduction of wolves in the Northeast. ``We're going
to urge people to support the strongest recovery plan possible, and
to oppose the downlisting.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, wolves are considered endangered in all of the lower
48 states except Minnesota. They would remain so in the Southwest
under Babbitt's proposal, which would be final a year from now
after public hearings. Even if wolves are downlisted to threatened,
it would still be illegal to shoot them.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal survives the public debate ahead, it would
signify an extraordinary compromise between critics and supporters
of wolf recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have included private property groups and many states,
including New Hampshire where the legislature approved a bill last
year banning wolf reintroduction there. On the other side,
environmental groups have played on the wolf's charisma to build
support for reintroducing the animal.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise is evident in the Service's plan to involve
critics and supporters in writing the recovery plan, the document
that will guide efforts to build up wolf populations. And, under a
special rule included in the proposal for the Northeast, wolves
that kill livestock or otherwise threaten people and property could
be shot or relocated. Such concessions are intended to appease
landowners and legislators alike, who may fear the federal
government even more than the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would give us quite a bit more flexibility,'' said Paul
Nickerson, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast
regional endangered species office. ``Unlike other areas of the
country, where there is a great deal of public land, whatever
recovery we do here will occur on private land, with the full
cooperation of private landowners.''
</P>
<P>
   To the timber industry, which owns millions of acres in the four
states and has been uneasy about wolf recovery, such overtures are
welcome. They are nervous that wolves may wander into Maine from
Canada, potentially triggering all sorts of efforts to protect the
animals at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in
Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a
current population.
</P>
<P>
   Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of
helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and
other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the many restrictions that often follow Endangered
Species Act listings, it'd be a stretch to say our members would be
thankful if wolves actually do show up in Maine,'' said Andrew
Kekacs, a spokesman for the Maine Forest Products Council. ``But if
they do, at least we'd know that we're not doing anything in our
forest practices that's incompatible with them.''
