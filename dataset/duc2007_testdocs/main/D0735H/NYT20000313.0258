   DULUTH, Minn. _ Wolves prowl late in summer nights through the
streets of Brasov, a Romanian city of 320,000, as well as its
municipal garbage dump and a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   A no-less-bold wolf was shot and killed last year within the
city limits of Rochester, Minn. Wolves stroll the town of Ely, on
the edge of the state's rapidly expanding wolf range, and one was
tracked to within 19 miles of St. Paul, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Wolves have denned 25 miles from Rome where 2,800 years ago,
according to legend, a she-wolf suckled the abandoned Romulus, its
founder, and his twin, Remus.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of extinction less than 40 years ago in many
countries, wolves have made a remarkable comeback and while
generally regarded as an extremely shy species, their presence in
or near urban centers should not come as a surprise, says Dr. L.
David Mech, a biologist with the United States Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have altered the concept of wolf habitat,'' he said. ``That
habitat is where wolves have prey and food and where people let
them live.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Minnesota, wolf recovery is surging to such
levels that Mech, widely regarded as the doyen of wolf specialists
around the world, and others, say that prudent wolf managers must
consider controlled killing.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at the end of a symposium here that drew more than 600
wildlife biologists, managers, educators and wolf fans from 44
states and 28 countries late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day conference, ``Beyond 2000 _ Realities of Global
Wolf Restoration,'' assessed recent efforts to reintroduce and
protect wolves in a number of countries after centuries of
officially authorized extirpation of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, for instance, has fostered a recolonization of vast areas
of Galicia and Asturias. There are more than 2,000 wolves in the
northwest of the country, a three-fold increase in a decade, said
Juan Carlos Blanco of Madrid's wolf project. ``Wolves can live
thanks to urban people's tolerance,'' he said. ``But farmers say,
`Kill all of them.' There is no common ground. We have a social war
in the name of the wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, with 500 wolves, is another restoration success, with
tolerance of increased numbers aided by subsidies for owners of
lifestock lost as prey to wolves and the skilled deployment of
guard dogs by shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Professor Luigi Boitani, a wolf biologist at the University
of Rome, has begun to ask himself, ``Did we do something wrong?''
The fact that ``today most of the public is in favor of wolves'' in
Italy has made it impossible for him to convince people of the need
for control of the wolf population. ``I tell people if we want the
wolf to come back, one day we'll have to kill them. But I find I
confront a very strong wall of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia, Dr. Djuro Huber of the University of Zagreb, wishes
he had Italy's problems. After many years of unlimited killing of
wolves, Croatia inaugurated protections in 1995 that include fines
of $6,000 for the willful killing of wolves. ``It went the opposite
of expectations,'' he said. ``Killing of wolves increased after
protection. Over 40. No one has paid the fine.'' Huber was even
threatened when he was in the field doing research on wolves. The
country now has about 100 wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers told of similar problems, suggesting that, just
as in ancient times, wolves still evoke extreme emotions: what
Blanco of Madrid called ``pathological hatred,'' and opposed to
that, an almost irrational devotion. Wolf lovers manifested the
latter at the conference with wolf pins, T-shirts, posters, books,
coffee mugs and fairly frequent, piercing wolf howls.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, Dr. Iyad A. Nader of Saudi Arabia, said,
``The wolf is considered the ancient enemy of man in the Middle
East.'' As in other countries, Saudi hunters who succeed in killing
a wolf often string up the carcass on a pole to show off. Nader, of
the King Khalid Wildlife Research Center in Riyadh, estimated a
total of 600 to 700 wolves in three protected areas of Saudi
Arabia. Otherwise they are not protected.
</P>

   Countries with large wolf populations generally have large
problems with them, judging from the conference presentations.
Kazakhstan, has probably largest: 90,000 to 100,000 wolves. Sergei
Pole estimated that in 1987 and 1988 wolves killed 150,000 or more
domestic animals, mainly camels, cows and sheep, as well as 14,000
wild animals including boar, deer, ibexes, elk and bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were 50 attacks by rabid wolves on humans,
said Pole, from the zoology laboratory of the Plague Control
Research Institute in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan.
Russia, despite heavy hunting and killing of wolves _ some 15,000
in 1998 alone, by all methods including poison _ still has a
population of 45,000, according to a comprehensive winter survey.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bounties are no longer paid on killed wolves and only
some state governments pay the equivalent of $25 for a killed
female. And the central government no longer encourages poisoning
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Nikita G. Ovsianikov, a wolf specialist from Moscow, said that
nevertheless ``attitudes still remain negative'' with surveys
showing that wolves are seen as threats to livestock, despite the
paucity of attacks and that hunters believe that wolves kill prized
game and hunters' dogs. He listed statistics from the Tver region
that showed hunters killed far more dogs than wolves had killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ovsianikov said he was pleasantly surprised there was no
opposition to the Russian project to transform the
2,000-square-mile Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean into a nature
preserve with a wolf colony. Wolves are needed, he said, to cull
Wrangel's large herds of musk oxen and reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Japan, which ``got rid of its last wolves 100
years ago,'' said Naoki Maruyama of the Japan Wolf Association.
Opinion polls show skepticism toward reintroduction, not least
because people believe there is ``no space'' for them. Even
biologists are ``very conservative'' on the predators. But he saw
hope for wolves in the need to control Japan's proliferating Sika
deer, which are damaging forests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only country with lots of wolves and no outstanding
problems is Romania, which has an ancient tradition of honoring
wolves. The pre-Christian Dacian people even had a flag with a
wolf's head, Ovidiu Ionescu of the Ministry of Environment said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Romania's 2,500 wolves, weighing as much as 150 pounds
each, live in the heavily forested Carpathian Mountains, where
there are about 5 million people and millions of sheep. The sheep
are protected by shepherds' guard dogs, said Christoph Promberger
of the Munich Wildlife Society, and wolves prey largely on chamois,
roe deer and red deer.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to track wolves on mountain slopes, Promberger
asked a Romanian shepherd for guidance. ``What are you looking for
up here; they are down there,'' said the shepherd, pointing below
to Brasov. Following this lead with night tracking equipment,
Promberger trailed a wolf through the city to garbage cans, the
dump and a shopping mall. He showed a film of the wolf at the
Duluth conference.
