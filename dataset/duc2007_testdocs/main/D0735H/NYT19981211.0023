   Greg Collins still wore blood-stained khaki pants as his friends
dragged him from the Bear Wallow Cafe _ the end of another
successful day of elk hunting in the heart of eastern Arizona wolf
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with wolves,'' said Collins, a hunter,
miner and coppersmith who lives in the hills near Silver City, N.M.
``(But) I will shoot a wolf on sight, and I'd like the FBI tagging
along. You are not going to tell me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Collins' view seems contradictory, it reflects a deep-rooted
conflict many folks along the Arizona-New Mexico line have about
the federal government's program this year to repopulate the Apache
and Gila national forests with endangered Mexican gray wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Many here say they are not so much against the wolves, as they
are against what the wolf represents: the steady erosion of a
Western lifestyle dependent on mining, ranching and logging.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the wolves have been shot to death, a federal crime that
carries a potential fine of $100,000 and a year in prison. A
state-federal task force is investigating, but so far has not filed
charges against anyone. A $50,000 reward has been offered for the
capture of the wolf killers.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding the killings has led to claims of death
threats received by ranchers and environmentalists. But no one has
been harmed, and no sheep or cattle have been eaten by wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Between conflicting theories of intentional sabotage and random
accidents, Collins shares another theory that the wolves were
intentionally shot by different people in opportunistic moments of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal? You see a wolf, you shoot a wolf,'' said
Max Schowengerdt, a former Las Vegas, Nev., construction contractor
who recently retired to the mountains of western New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To these hunters, the potential suspects in the wolf shootings
could include anyone in the economically depressed region, which
has an unemployment rate three times the states' averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every truck that goes down this street has a gun in it. Does
that mean they're militia? No. It's because their daddy and their
daddy's daddy had guns,'' Schowengerdt said.
</P>
<P>
   There also are those who believe that the wolves were mistaken
for coyotes, even though wolves are nearly three times the size of
coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are Jess Carey, a former Catron County sheriff and
gun shop owner from Reserve, N.M., who was subpoenaed last month by
a federal grand jury investigating the wolf killings.
</P>
<P>
   Carey turned over reams of records, guns and ammunition to
special agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, anything that
related to the kinds of shell casings found near the dead wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fish and Wildlife Service says they have no
suspects, Carey said he was handed a piece of paper _ with his name
on it _ that listed the suspects in the wolf killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew each and every one of these people who bought these
guns, and not one of them was capable of shooting any wolves,''
Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could be so sure, he said, ``Because everyone of
those people are law-abiding citizens. And they're not going to go
out here and shoot a wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the wolves represent the latest intrusion by
environmentalists and federal land managers.
</P>
<P>
   Timber production has fallen throughout Arizona and New Mexico
as federal land managers move to comply with federal court orders
in lawsuits brought by environmentalists aimed as saving other
threatened and endangered wildlife such as the Mexican spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   Falling copper prices also are forcing layoffs of hundreds of
miners in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And ranchers are under pressure to cut back their herds in areas
where federal land managers move to restore rivers and streams
damaged by decades of overgrazing livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Marks, for example, has cut his herds in half in recent
years, and he faces more cuts next year. At the same time, federal
officials plan to release at least one wolf pack near Bear Valley,
within a quarter-mile of spring calving areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they (wolves) have to do is find one stillborn calf, and
they'll be right on them,'' said Marks, who worked throughout the
summer to scare wolves away from his cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of cooperation I'm getting,'' Marks said of
the releases planned near his ranch in the Blue Range Primitive
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to their release into the wild, wolves have been put in
acclimation pens that ring the Primitive Area. After several weeks,
they are released into the forest. Four more wolves currently in
such pens will be released today. And at least two more wolf packs
will be released from acclimation pens in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of acclimation pens has led to accusations by
ranchers that the wolves _ which were raised in zoos and other
captive breeding facilities _ are too dependent on humans bringing
them food. Ranchers say that the wolves starved when they weren't
fed road-kill and that the wolves are attracted by the sound of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Parsons, Mexican wolf recovery leader for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said wolves have learned on their own to hunt
wild game _ mostly elk, which compete with cattle for forage. The
wolves, he said, are afraid of people, but don't seem to move far
enough away to keep from being shot.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ongoing reintroduction experiment, biologists
plan to release one or two pairs of wolves _ possibly by helicopter
_ directly into the Blue Range Primitive Area, a roadless zone
where mechanized vehicles are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   No pens are allowed to be built inside the Primitive Area, and
wolves released there will be forced to fend for themselves right
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to avoid confusing them with coyotes, federal
officials are releasing the wolves today with brightly colored
radio collars and brightly painted markings on their hips.
</P>
<P>
   If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone
who purposely wanted wolves dead. Because most mammals are
colorblind, the markings will not affect the wolves' ability to
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But the new wolf-painting effort was criticized Thursday by
Peter Galvin, conservation biologist for the Tucson-based Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he believes coyote hunting should be outlawed in the
wolf recovery area.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting coyotes is a time-honored pastime in the rural
Southwest. Many believe that killing coyotes means more deer, elk
and antelope fawns will survive each spring. But biological studies
show that no matter how many coyotes are killed, they reproduce
rapidly, and quickly fill every ecological niche available.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National
Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the
reintroduction of wolves. &QL;
