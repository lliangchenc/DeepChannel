<HEADLINE> Court To Keep Wolves in Rockies  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE GUTTERMAN Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of
transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision
environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming
federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in
Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they
say the wolves endanger livestock. They also claim that the program is
unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only
a few lone native wolves.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and
state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered
Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental
population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock. The farm groups said
the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing
different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
</P>
<P>
	   But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section
added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department
flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering
threatened animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological
reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other
government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision
sets an important precedent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van
Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision
has ``enormous significance nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in
Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf
reintroduction program.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Robinett, who says his livestock has been attacked repeatedly by wolves
at his ranch in Dubois, Wyo., about 40 miles from Yellowstone, was disappointed
with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just don't think they paid close enough attention to what was presented
to them,'' he said. ``Maybe they weren't well-versed in the Endangered Species
Act.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, U.S. District Judge William Downes ordered the reintroduced wolves
removed but stayed his ruling pending the decision by the federal appeals court.
