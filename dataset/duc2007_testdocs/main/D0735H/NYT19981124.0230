WOLF KILLED-ARIZONA (Undated) - Someone killed yet another
endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials
said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought
back to the wild this year. The latest killing has
environmentalists calling for FBI and National Guard intervention.
Also, new evidence says a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the
wolves' slaughter. Ironically, that is the same amount the federal
government and environmentalists are offering for information
leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers. By STEVE
YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

$100 MILLION-GIFT (Undated) - Pretty soon, the University of
Arizona is going to get it over with, and just rename the place
Rogers University. Alumnus James Rogers on Tuesday became one of
the largest benefactors in the history of higher education,
donating $100 million to the UA law school, with the possibility
that the gift will climb to $130 million. If that occurs, it will
be one of the five largest gifts in American academic history.
Rogers had the law school named after him last week, and will sit
on the board of the foundation that will administer his gift. Is he
perhaps getting too influential? By MARTIN VAN DER WERF. Story will
move inthe ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NURSES-SHORTAGE (Undated) - The promise of sunny skies, a casual
lifestyle and friendly people lured Barbara Griffin from Pittsburgh
to Arizona this year, nudging the state closer to overcoming a
shortage of up to 10,000 nurses. But not nearly close enough. So
hospitals in Phoenix and Tucson are offering free trips to Hawaii,
signing bonuses of up to $6,000 and other incentives to attract
nurses willing to work long hours under stressful conditions. Some
who already have jobs in Phoenix say they're so worn out that they
welcome all the help they can get. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHILD ABUSE-ARIZONA (Undated) - Thirteen-year-old Andy wore two or
three pairs of underwear under his jeans and slept fully dressed in
the months after he got home from spending half a year in foster
care. Now 14, Andy averts his eyes when he talks about what
happened to him in that shelter in Mesa in late 1996 and 1997. Andy
was taken from his mother because child welfare officials said
their house was too filthy. `Basically,'' the boy says, sinking
down in a cushioned chair in his mother's office, ``I was raped.''
As many as 250 Arizona children were sexually abused while in
foster care over a decade, according to a lawsuit filed in Tucson
in 1994. Pima County Presiding Judge Michael Brown is considering
whether to grant class action status to the lawsuit. By KARINA
BLAND. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WELFARE2WORK (Phoenix) - Desperate for workers to fill jobs in
their booming companies, some small businesses are turning to that
once-shunned group: welfare recipients. A look at who's hiring them
and how it works out. By JANE LARSON. Story will move in the ``F''
category. &QL;

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ They may argue over where the
original Thanksgiving was held, but the meaning isn't changed. An
offbeat look at things to be thankful for. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ.
Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The government is going after the killer
with a vehemence every victim's family dreams about. A member of
the president's cabinet flew in to the area to draw attention to
the case. A $30,000 reward is being offered for information leading
to the arrests of the killer or killers. In this case, though, the
victim is a wolf. By E.J. MONTINI Story moved in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RAVE-ARIZONA (Undated) - In a back alley off Main Street in Mesa,
Ariz., hundreds of teenagers and young adults converge in a
kaleidoscopic tangle, dressed like sci-fi conventiongoers on their
way to an all-night slumber party. They're jittery with a
can't-wait feeling, knowing they'll soon be psychicly free-falling
through a rave, a form of all-night, semi-clandestine partying that
has re-invented itself again and again over the past 10 years. It
has becomes more slick, commercial and global in its reach. There's
a rave every weekend in the Phoenix area, drawing at least 1,000
young people, who find their way to the site by dialing up a
recorded message or clicking on a Web site. Drugs are part of the
scene to some degree. But more important are the opportunities a
rave offers for losing yourself in pulsating music, escaping your
frustrations, feeling free enough to fly. With Photos. By JAYE
BEELER. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;
