<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department will announce on Monday
that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for
gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes,
because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they believed it was time to remove
about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the
list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act,
turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be
reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of
threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in
controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their
numbers increase.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton
administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species
Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the
Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said
they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the
Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step
forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted
almost to extinction. The rugged canines with the haunting howl
have loped through primeval forests just as they prowl the human
psyche in myth, folk tale and nursery rhyme. Today, they have
recaptured a revered status among conservation groups, reflecting
their important ecological role as a top predator.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Babbitt and Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the changes would not
lessen the likelihood that wolf packs would continue to thrive and
to extend into new territories.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt plans to explain the policies on Monday while visiting a
wildlife science center in Minnesota where the animals are held
captive to help rebuild their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that
were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho,
reproducing successfully, even though these populations might be
reclassified from endangered to threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a
subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in
the Southeast. Gray wolves in Alaska have never been listed as
endangered or threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Formal proposals will be published in a few months. The changes
in the wolves' legal status are not likely to occur before 1999,
but officials said the department's intentions were unlikely to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to acknowledge success,'' Babbitt
said. ``One reason the Endangered Species Act was in question was
the opponents were saying it did not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's proposals for managing wolves have long been
contentious, but this time some conservation groups are willing to
support easing the protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is the right thing for the wolves, at the right
time,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife
Foundation. ``It is the way the Endangered Species Act was designed
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of relaxing the protections for wolves say that the
change will make it easier to convince farmers and ranchers that
the wolves can expand into new areas without threatening their
livelihoods. The wolves eat anything from small animals like mice
and rabbits to larger species like sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   A population of wolves listed as threatened or not listed for
the law's protections at all may be managed under state or Federal
plans that allow some wolves to be killed and some of their habitat
destroyed, as long as helping the species recover remains the
overall objective.
</P>
<P>
   When the population is classified as endangered, tighter
protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are
more likely to resist reintroduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered
species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the
Endangered Species Act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   No wolf recovery plan has been drafted for the Northeast, but
proponents believe that the Adirondacks and Maine provide suitable
conditions, and planning may now begin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might be possible for wolves to move naturally back
into the Northeast from Canada, little migration has been detected.
The government is far from committing to a reintroduction of the
wolves, but the legal doors have cracked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have immediate plans for reintroduction? No,'' Ms. Clark
of the Fish and Wildlife Service said. ``But there is suitable
habitat, there is a potential opportunity, there are suitable prey
species.'' In the Northeast, moose and white-tail deer would be
among the gray wolf's prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the vision for the grand Laurentian forest from the
Adirondacks up to Maine is to bring back the wolves,'' Van Putten
said. ``We think the proposal Secretary Babbitt is going to
announce will make it more likely that that will happen.''
