<P>
   At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals,
biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican
wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's
Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated
20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to
restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became
extinct in the wild in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year biologists, who have bred from just 5
animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100
in the wild and 240 in captivity, had begun reintroducing the
wolves into the wild again. But whether they can achieve their
goal, and at what cost to the wolves, remain open questions.
</P>
<P>
   Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and
fishing, captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea
for species teetering on the edge of extinction. Zoos began to
promote themselves as latter-day Noah's Arks, capable of preserving
stable, genetically sound populations of rare animals until the
world was ready to welcome them back to a reconstructed nature, be
it a century or more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 80s, the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves,
California condors, and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order
to restore their populations through captive breeding, in
cooperation with zoos, and then return them to their native
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the
world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans
for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene
banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the World Conservation Union's captive breeding
specialist group suggested that the world's zoos could breed and
maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three
other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and
promise of reintroducing captive bred animals. The program to
restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when
officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that
had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey.
</P>
<P>
   With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in
eastern North Carolina, project leaders are seeking suitable
habitat for future releases, but blocks of more than 170,000 acres
with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient
prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, biologists estimate that there are as many as
56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and
adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater
that became extinct in the wild in 1987. And the black-footed
ferret, which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago, is
producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity, primarily
in South Dakota, Montana, and a large breeding operation in
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable.
Although they have bred well in captivity, none of the released
condors has yet reproduced in the wild, and they are particularly
sensitive to lead, which litters the landscape and is toxic to them
in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, a plague is obliterating black-tailed prairie
dogs, the black-footed ferrets' sole food source. Even without the
plague, habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development
and prairie-dog eradication programs.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gober, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist
in Pierre, S.D., said, ``I don't expect the ferret ever to be
recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered
to threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these
programs, captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a
costly, often futile exercise that does little to address the
underlying problems, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, not
to mention poaching and pollutants, that are pushing species toward
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the condor, wolf and ferret programs have already
cost more than $50 million. A five-year, $2.3 million effort
initiated by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association to establish
a captive breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros collapsed in
1993 without producing a single birth or protecting any wild
rhinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noah's Ark theory has no validity,'' said Christopher
Servheen, coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grizzly
bear recovery program and co-chairman of the World Conservation
Union's bear specialist group. ``You're not going to have more
habitat in 50 or 100 years than you do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is
wasteful of individual animals, many of which die because they do
not know how to live outside a cage. Other problems include a lack
of space and resources for preserving populations of animals
indefinitely, the development of behavioral problems in some
species, and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to
genetic abnormalities and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to breed some species, including clouded leopards, wooly
monkeys, African wild dogs, Sumatran rhinos, and the Micronesian
kingfisher, have faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captive-breeding industry creates the idea that we're
techno-fixing the problem,'' said Dale Jamieson, the Henry R. Luce
professor in the human dimensions of global change at Carleton
College in Northfield, Minn. ``In a way it's an elaborate fiction
that allows people to say, `Isn't it great, these animals are being
saved.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vast majority of programs have failed to meet
expectations. In 1994, Benjamin Beck, associate director of the
National Zoological Park in Washington, and three collaborators
found that of 145 documented reintroductions in this century
involving 115 species, only 16 (11 percent) had produced
populations that were sustaining themselves in the wild without
human assistance, and only half of those were endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Successful projects mostly involved herbivores, birds and
reptiles, including the Plains bison, Arabian oryx, bald eagle,
peregrine falcon, wood duck, and Galapagos tortoise.
