<P>
   Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and
Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, federal officials say,
that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in
the Northern Rockies have now been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to
wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and
roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward
E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service
who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. The wilderness of
central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults
and 60 to 65 pups.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and
1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their
populations since then.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now
inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward
expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various
causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto
collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots. Most of the latter
killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at
least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated,
making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a
single Rockies population.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have
taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last
year. One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and
Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary. The
Jackson pack has adopted the National Elk Refuge as its winter
hunting ground. One could sit in Jackson this winter, ``sipping
your latte and watching nature at work'' as the wolves hunted down
elk, Bangs said.
</P>
<P>
   In another ecological milestone, he said, one Yellowstone pack
has learned to attack and kill bison in the park and is now
something of a bison specialist. The Yellowstone wolves generally
have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were
confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves. Nearly $70,000 in
compensation was paid to the affected owners from a fund maintained
by the Defenders of Wildlife, according to a report by Bangs and
others in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin.
Forty-seven wolves were moved after depredations, and 43 marauding
wolves have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in
Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle,
valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court has decided that the rules under which
reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species
Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and
Yellowstone. The case is now on appeal. As a practical matter,
Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established
that removing them would be a problem. ``You could remove all the
wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are
not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find. ``To recapture
all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
</P>
<P>
   If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the
Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection
under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100
wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dad-gum close to the countdown'' to that day, said
Bangs.
