<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- About 600 people gathered Sunday night for  
a candelight vigil honoring Matthew Shepard, the gay college 
student who was fatally beaten and tied to a post a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of  
peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev. Roger Schmit, of St. Paul's 
Newman Center, told people on the University of Wyoming campus. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes  
on trial Monday on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and 
aggravated robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in  
April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a  
remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into 
unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. 
</P>
<P>
	He died on Oct. 12, 1998, and McKinney's trial begins amid  
several memorials commemorating the one-year anniversary of his 
death.
