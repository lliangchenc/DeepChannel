HEARING PRODUCES NEW DETAILS IN KILLING OF GAY STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>

   Before savagely beating Matthew Shepard with a pistol butt, one
of his tormentors taunted him, saying, ``It's Gay Awareness Week,''
a police investigator has testified at a hearing in Laramie, Wyo.,
for one of two men accused of the murder of the gay college
student.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony, by Sgt. Rob Debree, came at a daylong proceeding
Thursday. In the evening, Robert Denhardt, a visiting county judge,
ordered Aaron McKinney, 22, to stand trial on charges of
first-degree murder, robbery and kidnapping. The other suspect,
Russell Henderson, 21, a friend of McKinney, has waived his right
to a preliminary hearing and is to be arraigned on the same charges
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearing, Dennis and Judy Shepard, parents of the
slain student, sat stoically in Albany County Court as police
witnesses provided new details about a crime that produced a
national wave of anger at anti-gay violence.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of
Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had
attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's
Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview
with McKinney on Oct. 9, two days after the beating and three days
before Shepard died in a hospital in nearby Fort Collins, Colo. In
that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had
identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out
of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   By McKinney's account, the detective said, the attack began
after Shepard had placed his hand on McKinney's leg as they drove
through Laramie. ``Guess what, we're not gay,'' the detective
quoted McKinney as saying he had told Shepard. ``You're going to
get jacked. It's Gay Awareness Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective said McKinney had admitted hitting Shepard three
times with fists and six times with a stolen revolver.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Shepard had been hit 18 times in the head.
He was also bruised on the backs of his hands, indicating that he
had tried to protect himself, and around the groin, indicating that
he had been kicked repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 hours after the beating, a bicyclist found him still
alive, tied to a ranch fence. Reggie Fluty, an Albany County
sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had
been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope
and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot
``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face.''
</P>
<P>
   A Laramie police officer, Detective Ben Fritzen, testified that
he had interviewed Kristen Price, McKinney's 18-year-old
girlfriend. Fritzen said that in explaining the violence, McKinney
had told Ms. Price, ``Well, you know how I feel about gays,''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price and Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, waived
their right to preliminary hearings and are to be arraigned on Dec.
9 as accessories after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   A public defender for McKinney, Dion Custis, told the judge at
the hearing that the state had failed to prove that the slaying had
been planned, as is required for first-degree murder, or that
Shepard had been kidnapped. Custis also said a watch and other
belongings left at the crime scene showed that robbery was no
factor.
</P>
<P>
   But Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said Shepard's
wallet had been found in a dirty diaper in the kitchen of the
Laramie apartment shared by McKinney, Ms. Price and their
4-month-old son, Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the judge, Rerucha said: ``They beat him for $20,
your honor. That was the contents of the wallet.''
