	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers  
involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely 
injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the  
media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more 
difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge 
Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers  
representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the  
death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured 
from a bar in October and fatally beaten. He received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying  
him to a fence, but said he tried to intervene to prevent McKinney 
from inflicting a more severe beating. He said McKinney, who has 
yet to be tried, struck him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson  
fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies  
of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney, 
drawing another round of criticism from Custis.
