<HEADLINE> Witness: Shepard Provoked Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man testified he was angered by a sexual  
advance by gay college student Matthew Shepard inside the same bar 
that Shepard later met up with his alleged killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael St. Clair was the first defense witness called in the  
murder trial of Aaron McKinney. The defense opened its case Friday. 
McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder, and 
could be sentenced to death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty  
of manslaughter rather than murder. They have argued that he 
snapped during a drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance 
by Shepard triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair told jurors Shepard asked to sit with him inside the  
Fireside Lounge on Oct. 6, 1998, before making a sexual suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really offensive to me,'' St. Clair said. ``It set off  
something inside. It made me angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard later met McKinney and Russell Henderson at the bar,  
where St. Clair said he saw the three leave together. Prosecutors 
say the two lured Shepard out of the bar, took him to a remote area 
where they robbed and beat him. He was left to die tied to a fence 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 22, is serving two life sentences after pleading  
guilty to murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense testimony began, attorneys asked the judge to  
allow them to use the ``gay panic'' strategy, contending it is 
crucial for jurors to understand why the roofer beat Shepard to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``These life experiences may say how he reacted that evening,''  
defense attorney Dion Custis said in a hearing after prosecutors 
rested their case. ``That is for a jury to decide, not the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give  
others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have a conspiracy of two people who go out and  
pretend to be homosexuals and commit a robbery and claim homosexual 
panic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barton Voigt said he would rule on the issue Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, prosecutors rested their case against McKinney.  
</P>
<P>
	During four days of testimony, prosecutors drew a timeline of  
the events, culminating in the playing of McKinney's jailhouse 
confession, in which he described in detail how Shepard was beaten.
