   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California's hate crime law would get
beefed up for murderers of gays, lesbians and the disabled under a
measure approved by the Assembly with strong Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   Current California law requires a sentence of life in prison
without parole or the death penalty for anyone who deliberately
sets out to kill someone because of race, color, religion or
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   A measure written by Assemblyman Wally Knox, a Democrat from Los
Angeles, would add disability, gender and sexual orientation to
that list with one important caveat: It would not give jurors the
option of imposing the death penalty in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his own objections and concerns from gays and
lesbians, Knox's bill would instead increase the penalty from the
current 25 years to life in prison, to life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorneys literally were having cases where
people confessed that they had murdered people because they were
gay or lesbian, and could not charge them with special
circumstances,'' Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   His measure passed the Assembly Wednesday with a 55-17 vote and
now moves to the Senate. The bill got the support from some of the
most conservative Republicans, who saw the legislation as tough on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose, offered an
amendment Wednesday to add the death penalty to the bill, but was
turned down by the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Knox bill, a prosecutor must prove the victim was
intentionally killed because of his or her actual or ``perceived''
disability, gender or sexual orientation. The bias must be an
actual cause or substantial factor in prompting the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice said 10 people had been
murdered in the state between 1995 and 1997 as a result of hate
crimes, although a number for gay-related murders was not
available. There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them
murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate
Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie,
Wyo., last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in
legislatures around the country this year on issues important to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is tracking several in
California, including a measure to protect gay and lesbian high
school students from discrimination.
