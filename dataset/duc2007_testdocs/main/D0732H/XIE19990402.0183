<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges Unified Education System in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Ministry of East African
and Regional Cooperation has called for the harmonization of
education in the east African region, including similar curricula
and certification.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Samuel Ambuka said the move would help
attain a state of singularity in the region's economic management
and social organization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system,
which means eight years of primary school, four years of high
school and four years of

university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both
Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult.
</P>
<P>
"It brings in the problems of differences in the basic skills
and knowledge a student ought to have to acquire at the various
levels of education, and the question of assessment of points and
credits in the three countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the three east African nations set up joint
teams to study curricula, examination and certification of
primary, secondary and college education as a basis for
harmonization of curricula and certification.
</P>
<P>
On Kenya's 8-4-4 curricula, Ambuka admitted that it emphasized
a wide range of subjects at the expense of in-depth analysis.
