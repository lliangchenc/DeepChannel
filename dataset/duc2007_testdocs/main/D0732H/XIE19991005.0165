<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Urges Kenya to Adopt Sex Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has urged Kenya's Education Ministry to include sex
education in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF country representative Chrispin Wilson said Monday
that it was essential to provide information about HIV/AIDS to the
youth in order to curb the spread of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"Using schools as the means to reach children aged between five
and 14 to induce behaviour change through HIV/AIDS education are
some of the best methods to try to stop the spread of the virus,"
said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will have about 850,000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000,
according to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The newly infected were young people in Kenya, where the HIV
infection rate has reached 13 to 14 percent, said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the age group most at risk was between 15 and
24 and girls aged between 15 and 19 were at a much higher risk of
contracting the virus than boys.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Catholic church leaders and some politicians are
strongly against adolescent sex education citing it would mislead
young people.
