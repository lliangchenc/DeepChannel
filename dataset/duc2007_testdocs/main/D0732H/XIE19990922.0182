NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya government is
worried that the high drop-out rates in schools may frustrate its
efforts to achieve education for all by 2050.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation Newspaper Wednesday quoted a top education
official as saying that more students have dropped out in the past
decade despite a "substantial increase" in budgetary allocations.
</P>
<P>
Out of the pupils enrolled in Standard One, only 47 percent
complete the primary education; out of these, only 17 percent
survive to complete the secondary schooling, Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Wilfred
Kimalat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that only seven percent of high-school graduates are
lucky enough to go to public universities, which means that only
1.2 percent of those who begin the education cycle make it to
university.
</P>
<P>
According to Kimalat, the education allocations have more than
tripled over the past eight years.
