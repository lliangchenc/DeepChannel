NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has challenged investors to consider investing in higher
education in Kenya, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations International University in
Nairobi Friday, Moi said out of some 30,000 students who qualify
for university education in the country each year, less than 30
percent get admission to public universities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another five percent of those get admission in
private universities while the rest seek university education
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Presently, there are about 20,000 students studying abroad
whose expenditure is estimated to be 16 billion shillings (214
million U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The president urged private university to take advantage of the
quest for university education in Kenya by expanding their
facilities in order to enroll more students.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that his government is in the process of
revising the University Act of 1985 and the university rule of
1989 with a view of creating a more conducive environment for
private sector involvement in higher education.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the academic programs offered by the country's
institutions of higher learning should be market driven and
called on private universities to diversify their programs to
include basic and applied sciences.
