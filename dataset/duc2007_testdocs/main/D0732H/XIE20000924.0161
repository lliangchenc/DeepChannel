NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
published the University Bill 2000 to allow foreign universities
to establish constituent campuses in the east African country, the
Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka was quoted as saying
here on Saturday that the bill will be submitted to the parliament
for debate when it resumes next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, only foreign universities recognized in
their mother countries will qualify to operate campuses in Kenya,
he said.

<P>
According to the minister, foreign constituent colleges will
save Kenyans much in school fees and foreign exchange. "Kenya has
the capacity for more universities," he said.

<P>
Musyoka also praised private universities in Kenya, saying they
complement the government's efforts to provide higher education.

Earlier, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said the number of
Kenyan students who want a university education has far
outstripped the places at public universities and colossal amounts
of money is spent each year on education abroad.
