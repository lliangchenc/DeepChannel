<HEADLINE> Kenya to Open Enterprise Course in Primary </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate
a business culture among children in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The new subject, Entrepreneurship Education, will focus on
practical aspects of business management and industrial
development, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho announced on
Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is to inculcate a business and enterprising
culture in the minds of learners at an early age," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, it is just an additional one to the 13 subjects
taught in primary schools and will be non-examinable.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of the eight strategies for training and human
resource development in preparation for the country's
industrialization, said Kamotho.
</P>
<P>
Other strategies include strengthening of educational and
training programs for the disabled, ensuring street children get
access to education and offering a second chance to drop-outs to
improve their literacy and get short-time career training.
</P>
<P>
Training in the country's institutions would be harmonized
with the labor market requirements to correct the mismatch
between labor supply and demand, he stressed.
