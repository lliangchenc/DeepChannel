NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has decided to
issue a 1.6-billion-Shilling (26.66 million U.S. Dollars) grant
to help Kenya develop early childhood education in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to improve pre-school teacher performance,
and enhance community capacity building and mobilization, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional
Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets
include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school
to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education
monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's intervention has been necessitated by a strong
need for well-trained pre-school teachers in this east African
country, said Marito.
</P>
<P>
This has also been necessitated by the need to harmonize
pre-school education programs to accord near uniform pre-school
to primary school transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the sub-sector has a teaching force of 36,129. Out
of them, only 16,500 are fully trained.
</P>
<P>
According to the data from the Kenyan Ministry of Education
and Human Resources, the enrollment rose to the current 1,064,053
pupils from 844,796 in 1980.
