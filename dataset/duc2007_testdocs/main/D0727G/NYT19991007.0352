 &HT;    Gingrich wonders if wife had detective trailing him
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich wants to know whether his estranged wife
put him under surveillance shortly before he became speaker of the
U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out the former Georgia congressman no longer has a
house to call home in Cobb County, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and
documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington,
D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened
trial date.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more significant developments of the day, a
Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a
step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about
Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56. Bisek is an aide to
the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge ordered
the attorneys for Bisek and Marianne Gingrich to meet by next
Friday to discuss a subpoena ordering Bisek to be deposed and to
produce a wide range of evidence. The items include letters, gifts,
phone records and other items Marianne Gingrich could use to prove
Bisek was having an extramarital affair with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has asked the judge to block the subpoena, saying it was
issued incorrectly and is too vague. Bisek also argues that she is
being asked to incriminate herself. Adultery is a crime in the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge ruled Thursday that the subpoena was procedurally sound,
but the Washington judge wants the attorneys to agree on the scope
of the information that can be demanded of Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, Gingrich has asked his wife to respond to 26
questions and demands for discovery evidence by Wednesday, so his
attorneys can prepare for a deposition of Marianne Gingrich
scheduled for Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gingrich's questions are an attempt to learn everything
possible about the financial standing of his wife, who controlled
the couple's assets. And in most cases, Gingrich seeks financial
documents dating back to 1987, when the couple signed a separation
agreement splitting their possessions during a spat Gingrich says
lasted six years.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions in Gingrich's discovery notice seek to learn
about any marital improprieties on his wife's part. Still others
seek to know what, if anything, she has learned about Gingrich's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   One demand by Gingrich reads: ``Copies of any surveillance or
investigation reports, notes, or memos from 1994 to the date of
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of question is not uncommon in hard-fought divorce
cases, where spouses often hire detectives to sniff out everything
from finances to affairs, said Washington divorce lawyer Sanford
Ain. ``It's almost always asked when infidelity is an issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday also brought the public release of a Sept. 10 temporary
agreement the Gingriches signed splitting and securing their assets
while they litigate their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives Marianne Gingrich possession of the couple's
Marietta, Ga., home. Gingrich, who served metro Atlanta's 6th
Congressional District from Marietta for six of his 20 years in
office, will live in the couple's Washington apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also pays the Gingriches a monthly stipend of
$10,000 each. That represents an annual combined income of at least
$240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much money is at stake between the Gingriches is
uncertain. Even they are trying to figure that one, according to
court records.
