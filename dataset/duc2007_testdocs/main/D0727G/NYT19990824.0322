 &HT;    Marianne Gingrich claims husband Newt took 'valuable assets'

   ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt
Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's
assets until their divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition,
Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial
portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further
transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has
already transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation
and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug. 9 in Cobb Superior
Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is
accused of attempting to transfer. Her attorney, John Mayoue,
declined to elaborate on the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already
contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the
former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after
1998 GOP election losses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is
prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of
marriage. Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she
wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va., with
whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a
video-taped deposition of Bisek. Mayoue has said he intends to
question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt
Gingrich. A date for the deposition has been tentatively set for
Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a
relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.
