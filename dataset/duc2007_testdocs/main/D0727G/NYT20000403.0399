 &HT;    Gingriches sign divorce settlement likely to stay secret

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lawyer for Newt Gingrich says the former U.S. House
speaker and his wife have signed a final divorce settlement and are
ready to take the agreement to a Cobb County courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all done except for the formality of going to the judge
and getting it approved,'' said attorney Randy Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson has set a
hearing for Thursday morning. Even if Robinson accepts the
settlement, which is nearly certain, its terms will likely remain a
secret. Evans said both sides will ask the judge to sign an order
sealing the agreement, which would keep it out of the public court
file.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Marianne Gingrich could not be reached for comment
about the settlement, which is the product of more than three
months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got this much stuff, you just try to take your
time and get it right,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches agreed to settle their divorce Dec. 16, 1999,
during a court-ordered mediation session that lasted 12 hours and
ended well after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement, which the Gingriches have kept private,
ended what had become a bitter divorce process for Gingrich and his
wife of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of potentially embarrassing depositions in the case
led Gingrich, 56, to admit to a six-year affair with Callista
Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the U.S. House Agriculture
Committee. Divorce attorneys watching the case predicted early on
that Gingrich would settle the case, rather than allow his personal
life to be examined in a public trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches' divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and
Marianne Gingrich's first.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children together.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after
resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years,
and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House
Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, 48, has remained in the couple's Marietta,
Ga., home during the divorce proceedings. Gingrich has spent most
of his time in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich makes a living these days giving speeches, sitting on
corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst
on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds two fellowships and maintains a nonprofit
committee devoted to his political ideals.
