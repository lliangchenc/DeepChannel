 &HT;    Gingrich, wife agree on split of assets
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich agreed Monday to
keep their divorce out of a public arena _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches have reached a confidential agreement on how to
divide their income and assets while their legal separation
proceeds, avoiding an open and potentially contentious hearing this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans,
Newt Gingrich's attorney and longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   An assets hearing scheduled for Thursday before Cobb County
Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson is now unnecessary, Evans
said. But by late Monday the judge hadn't canceled what was to be a
first joint appearance in court by the Gingriches.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, confirmed that an
agreement was reached, but would give no details.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a sign that the Gingriches are willing to
compromise to keep their private lives out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday hearing was expected to attract national media,
whose reporting has been stoked by Newt Gingrich's relationship
with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific
charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed
for the divorce in July.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing the
former U.S. House speaker of attempting to transfer ``certain
valuable assets'' before filing for divorce. She did not specify
what the assets were, but she asked the judge to force her
estranged husband to return anything he took and stop him from
taking anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any truth to that, so there was nothing to
resolve,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, 56, retaliated with his own court filing, saying
his wife of 18 years held all the couple's personal liquid assets
when they separated. He further accused her of depleting ``a
substantial portion'' of those assets.
</P>
<P>
   The former 10-term congressman from Marietta, Ga., also
submitted a 1987 separation agreement that paid Marianne Gingrich
$12,000 in alimony over six months, and divided the couple's bank
accounts, furniture and cars. Newt Gingrich asked the judge to
determine whether the agreement was still technically in effect, or
whether the couple could structure a new separation agreement along
the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another Newt Gingrich attorney, Thomas Browning, said the
Gingriches had maintained separate residences for six years before
reconciling about late 1993. That news took Washington insiders and
Gingrich supporters at home by surprise. Marianne Gingrich, 48, has
admitted in the past that there was a separation years ago but has
declined to say how long it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that Newt Gingrich has chosen such a hurtful
strategy,'' said Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, before
Monday's agreement, ``especially considering his very public
conduct that's at the heart of this action.''
