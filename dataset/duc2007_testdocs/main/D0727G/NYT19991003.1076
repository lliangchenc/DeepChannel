   Gingrich divorce takes nasty turn
</P>
<P>
   By Duane D. Stanford
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich is back to bomb-throwing again.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by his estranged wife's attempts to probe his
finances, business dealings, and his relationship with a Washington
congressional aide, the former U.S. House speaker has unleashed his
divorce lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who rose to power by aggressively attacking Democrats
in Congress, will now put the same energy toward proving that his
wife shares the blame for the marriage's collapse, one of his
attorneys said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In pleadings released in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich,
56, is demanding that Marianne Gingrich sit for a videotaped
deposition on Oct. 19 _ just as she has demanded a videotaped
interrogation of Callista Bisek, a House Agriculture Committee
aide. Gingrich also is asking that Marianne Gingrich be ordered to
account for all the couple's cash and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the couple's accountant says otherwise, Gingrich's
attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich has not complied with
a Sept. 10 agreement that requires both to dump whatever money they
have into a joint account managed by an independent accountant. The
arrangement temporarily secures the couple's assets until their
divorce is final. Evans said he'll file another motion today asking
a judge to hold Marianne Gingrich in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that Newt Gingrich has not investigated this
matter and knows more that anyone else that Marianne Gingrich has
never done anything improper with the family money,'' responded
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
</P>
<P>
   The new filings are part of a nasty turn in the Gingriches'
split, as Gingrich takes the offensive for the first time since
filing for divorce in July. Evans has been filling in reporters
across the country on the new strategy, telling them that Gingrich
has wanted to settle the case without probes into his and Marianne
Gingrich's personal lives and finances outside their marriage. Such
digging is costly and could harm both their earning potential,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marianne Gingrich, 48, has insisted that her husband and
Bisek answer questions about their relationship under oath. She
also wants Bisek to turn over any gifts, letters or other
correspondence she may have received from Gingrich. Bisek, 33, has
asked a Washington judge to block the deposition, arguing _ in part
_ that since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia, she
shouldn't be asked to incriminate herself. A ruling is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, we are forced to litigate,'' Evans said. ``We are
going to proceed as quickly as we can to get this to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gingrich is accusing his wife of not accounting
for some of the public speaking money he has earned since the
September financial agreement. The fees for his speeches, which can
be as high as $50,000, go directly to Marianne Gingrich, who
manages all the couple's money, Evans said. Gingrich says he's
earned more than the $5,000 his wife has deposited in the joint
account so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any improprieties on either parties'
behalf,'' said Harvey Cohen, the certified public accountant hired
by the Gingriches to manage the account under their agreement. ``I
think both parties are showing good faith and moving forward as
they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the speech money is tied up in Gingrich Enterprises,
the company the Gingriches set up jointly to manage the business
end of Gingrich's speaking career.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he is waiting for the proper paperwork to be
completed so the funds can be transferred.
