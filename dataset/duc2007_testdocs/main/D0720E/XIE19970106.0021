<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Expresses Optimism After Secret Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- After an overnight secret
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about reaching a
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to businessmen in Tel Aviv today, Netanyahu said that
some progress had been achieved at his meeting with Arafat which
was held at the Eretz checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"We have made progress, but we still have not reached
agreement on all the issues. We will make sure that we will stand
firm on the principles of security and reciprocity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was optimistic about reaching peace and
security, adding that such negotiation required "patience."
</P>
<P>
Today's surprise meeting lasted for over three hours and ended
at seven O'clock this morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He said that positive results were achieved in the summit, but
there was still one major issue remaining unsettled -- the
timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment in rural areas
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat convened a meeting this afternoon of his senior
advisers and some members of the Palestinian negotiating team
to update his meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny
also took part in the meeting to learn about the latest
developments in the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been under fire recently from Israel, which alleged
that Cairo was using its influence to encourage the Palestinian
side to delay the Hebron deal so to extort more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian sources all agreed that, with today's
summit, the difficult Hebron talks that have been lingering on
for three months seemed to have taken a positive turn.
</P>
<P>
The summit was the result of Ross' intensive mediation efforts
as the U.S. is increasing pressure on both sides to wrap up the
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete
the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September
1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March. Israel has
delayed the Hebron pullback since the wave of Islamic suicide
bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack
of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links
the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further
pullback. It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of
Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to
bridge the remaining gap. He held a meeting with Arafat this
morning, and is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu late today.
