<HEADLINE> Three-Way Summit Could Achieve Positive Results: Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin expressed optimism here Tuesday that the three-way Camp
David summit could achieve positive results and agreement could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that agreement could be reached at this Camp
David summit because both (Israeli) Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat realize that the price of failure
at the summit talks would be high," Beilin told foreign reporters
at a press conference organized by the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Barak, Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton gathered
at Camp David near Washington Tuesday for the crucial summit, which
will try to reach a framework agreement on the key issues of
Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and
water.
</P>
<P>
"Without an agreement it will be bad, ....but I think the high
expectations and hopes create a situation whereby it is almost
impossible to return home without an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin was one of the architects who helped forge the 1993 Oslo
accords between Israel and Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization that provided outlines and principles for the
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
Each side has much to pay if there is a failure at the summit,
he said, adding that the agreement could not be reached without
compromises from both sides.
