<HEADLINE> Peres Welcomes Israeli-Palestinian Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres expressed Friday welcome to the peace agreement
reached by Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Wye Plantation
outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the plantation said that after nine
days of intensive talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached an agreement on
issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was planned at White House later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over another 13.1 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians, release part of the 3,400
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, open two roads between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip as safe passage while the Palestinian
side convenes its National Council to abrogate parts of the
anti-Israeli articles from its Chart and other concrete plans to
strengthen security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached at the Wye Plantation was a victory for
the Oslo accords which kicked off the Mideast peace process, Peres
told the Israeli TV Channel 1.
</P>
<P>
Agreement means everything has been decided on paper and its
implementation is more important, Peres said, urging both sides to
implement the agreement according to agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, only a minority of people oppose the peace and the
majority must support what has been reached at Wye Plantation,
Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also a Knesset (Parliament) member, contributed
a great deal in the peace process, particularly in formulating the
Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's right-wing groups and politicians strongly
opposed what has been reached at the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, told the Channel 1 that he will oppose
Netanyahu's decision to hand further West Bank land to the
Palestinians.
