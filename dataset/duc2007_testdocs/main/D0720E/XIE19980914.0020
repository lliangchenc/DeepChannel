<HEADLINE> Five Years Later, Oslo Agreement in Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, September 13 (Xinhua) -- When the historic Oslo
Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the
Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace. Five
years later, the rosy picture remains a dream.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo, most of the West Bank should have been handed
over to the Palestinians two years ago. Today, however, the
Palestinians are still struggling to get a small portion of the
land.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Israel, it is still dissatisfied with what the
Palestinians have done on fighting terrorism, declaring that more
Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years
since Oslo than in the 15 preceding years.
</P>
<P>
The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by
clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the
Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace
demonstrations in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians had been expected to sign an
agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in
Washington Sunday, but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is still shuttling
between the two sides to bridge their gaps over the second stage
of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the prospect of an
agreement remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo peace process went quite smoothly in its first two
years. Following a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by
Hamas against Israel in early 1996 and the current Likud
government came to power in the middle of that year, the peace
process began to falter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly
attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to
address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for
peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In line with this policy, Israel began to build Jewish
settlements, abolishing the former Labor government's policy of
freezing their establishment, and delayed the redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel also tightened the control over Jerusalem, on which
both Israel and the Palestinians claim sovereignty, by intensifying
settlement activity and demolishing Palestinian houses. In June
this year, it approved a controversial plan to expand the city
far beyond its current borders, annexing some areas in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
All these measures, together with sporadic Hamas terror
attacks, have derailed the Oslo process and led to the current
stalemate in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Oslo Accords have designed a confidence-building mechanism by
leaving most of the toughest issues to final status talks, but
the depth of recrimination between the two sides has shaken the
foundation of the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said that the Oslo Accords are in a coma,
if not dead, and the lack of mutual confidence is the root.
</P>
<P>
Five years of peace process, no matter how tortuous it goes,
have changed the attitudes of Israeli and Palestinian
people. Analysts said that more and more Israelis are accepting
the reality of a future Palestinian state and most Palestinians
believe there is no alternative to Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Since the deadline of Oslo Accords is approaching, analysts
noted that the two sides have to rebuild their mutual trust as
soon as possible and carry out all signed agreements seriously
and swiftly. That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords
envisioned five years ago, they said.
