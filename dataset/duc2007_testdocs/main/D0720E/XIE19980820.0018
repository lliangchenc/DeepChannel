<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No to Oslo's 5th Anniversary Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to attend a meeting in
Norway next week to mark the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Norwegian foreign minister
on Tuesday personally requested that Netanyahu attend the meeting,
but Netanyahu said he was too busy to go to Norway.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, also said the
prime minister had to deal with "more important things" in Israel
at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Netanyahu said he did not intend to travel to the
birth place of the Oslo Accords since he had no part in the
historic peace agreements. But he reportedly would send his
diplomatic advisor Uzi Arad to take part in the commemoration.
</P>
<P>
The question was in fact cropping up earlier this month when
the Norwegian government invited Netanyahu to attend the
celebrations. An aide to the prime minister said then that
Netanyahu "thought it would not look good if he attended, when
the Oslo work is not completed here."
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres are planning to attend
and scheduled to speak at the meeting to be held in Oslo next
Monday. U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross would also
participate, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on
principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the
Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since their signing in September in 1993, Netanyahu has
regularly attacked the Oslo Accords but has grudgingly reiterated
commitment to carry them forward.
</P>
<P>
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its
withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have
moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the
Oslo Accords.
