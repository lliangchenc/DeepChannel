<HEADLINE> 3 Palestinians Injured in Clashes With Israeli Soliders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinian
students were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers Tuesday at
Bitonia checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah,
Palestinian security police said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted when the Palestinian students threw stones
at the Israeli soliders, who responded with fired rubber-coated
bullets, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The students held a demonstration on the occation of May 4, the
date on which the five-year Palestinian interim self-rule period,
stipulated in the Oslo accords, expires, to demand an early end of
Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land and the declaration of
an independent Palestinian state in the territories.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement
should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the
date. And the Palestinians believe they have the right to declare
an independent state on the day.
</P>
<P>
However, a permanent peace accord remains out of reach by
Tuesday and Palestinian leadership has delayed decision over
statehood declaration until after the May 17 Israeli elections to
avoid squandering international good-will.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited dozens of states
to rally support for his statehood proclamation, but many states
urged him to hold off the unilateral move on May 4 to avert being
exploited by hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian police officer told Xinhua that everything
could happen in the territories today or tomorrow because the
Palestinians do not have their independent state in the
territories on the historic date.
</P>
<P>
"We are ordered to maintain order in the territories since
Monday night and we are prepared for any eventualities," the
officer said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Fatah movement also organized a large-scale demonstration in
the West Bank town of Hebron Tuesday morning, urging the
palestinian leadership to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched from the Hebron
University to the "border line" between H1 and H2, but no clashes
are reported so far.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Jewish settlers, whose settlements are located in H1
area, live among 130,000 Palestinians, whose living areas are
called H2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
is scheduled to hold a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in
Ramallah to demand the Palestinian leadership let the Palestinian
people exercise their sovereignty on the Palestinian land and get
rid of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another
Palestinian political faction, is to organize a demonstration
Tuesday afternoon in Gaza to voice its support for the declaration
of the statehood.
