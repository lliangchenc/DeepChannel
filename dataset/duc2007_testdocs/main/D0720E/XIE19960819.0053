<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Fails to Reach Agreement on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli senior cabinet
ministers today failed to reach agreement on a plan for the
Israeli army's redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of
Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The senior cabinet ministers will meet again in a later date
after the failure to reach any conclusions today due to the sharp
disagreement between the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The new plan was presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard
to the extent of Palestinians' control in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would
only gain the civilian control over the area, and the overriding
security control would remain in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back from
about 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab neighborhoods of the
town under the full control of the PNA, designated Zone A.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be
designated Zone A, but part of Zone B, an area of shared control,
with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it deems
necessary for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
During today's cabinet meeting, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy
of the National Religious Party demanded that the Jewish
community in Hebron be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials, having already accepted a
delay in the implementation of the Hebron redeployment,
repeatedly said that they would not renegotiate any signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria
stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on
the Hebron issue, saying the Israeli troops should pull out in
accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh also said that the Palestinians
would not agree to Israeli troop patrols in the Arab neighborhood
as part of an Israeli redeployment in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed to
pullback from of Hebron by March 28. However, following a series
of suicide bombing attacks, the redeployment was delayed.
</P>
<P>
Then the redeployment was postponed again due to the May 29
Israeli general elections for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said
he has been studying the issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but
giving no date when he would make the final decision.
