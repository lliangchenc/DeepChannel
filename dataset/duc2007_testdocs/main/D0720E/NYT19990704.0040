   Edward Said, America's foremost Palestinian patriot and
polemicist, sets forth Monday night on a journey ``In Search of
Palestine.'' He carries a heavy load of memories of a homeland that
was taken by force, leaving many of its people in refugee camps or
under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, Said finds fellow Palestinians being abused by
Israeli settlers and authorities. Their history, as he tells it,
began with ``the catastrophe'' of 1948, when hundreds of Arabs were
killed and thousands of others lost their homes and property to the
conquering Jews.

<P>
   In this hourlong BBC production, the prolific writer and scholar
sets aside his intellectual credentials and makes little attempt at
evenhanded reporting as he concentrates on his family's loss and on
what he sees as the continuing afflictions of the Palestinians.
Everywhere, the camera finds symbols of Israeli power: the guns and
bulldozers used to repress peaceable Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from his account is any acknowledgment that there may be
an Israeli side to the area's tumultuous history. Despite
expressions of sympathy from friendly Israelis, Said finds mainly
oppression by Jews and indifference by most of the world to what he
condemns as prevailing injustice: the years of expulsion, uprooting
and destruction, with no alleviation in sight. Arabs, he says, have
been demonized, while the ``barbaric, inhuman'' actions of the
Israelis go uncriticized.
</P>
<P>
   Said holds out little prospect that the Oslo accords will do
anything to improve the Palestinians' plight. As he sees the
situation, the new Palestinian authority is cooperating in holding
down the indigenous population; the land of his childhood is gone
forever. The viewer need not accept Said's sad and bitter polemic
as the whole story, affected as it is by his passion over the world
his people have lost.
