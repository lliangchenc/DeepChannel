<HEADLINE> PNA Official Urges Israel to Implement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the
Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel
should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed
with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against
the provisions of these agreements.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath made the remark while commenting on an Israeli document
concerning PNA's obligations and decisions relating to Israel's
security in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Israeli cabinet passed a 12-page document
accusing the PNA of violating its obligations. And on Wednesday,
the cabinet decided to keep all the areas in the West Bank it
termed as vital to Israel's security and national interests in a
permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
These areas include two security strips on each side of the
West Bank, water resources, Jewish settlements, strategic roads and
Jewish historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said the Hebron agreement signed early last year
stipulate that Israel carry out a three-stage troop redeployment
in the West Bank by mid-1998, adding the Israeli cabinet's
decisions on security issues in the West bank meant that it does
not want to redeploy its troops in the West Bank but rather
permanently occupy the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the final-status talks as initiated by Israel, he
said how the PNA could enter into such talks with the Israeli
government which refused to redeploy its troops in the West Bank
and commit to its obligations as specified by the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
The permanent solution of the Middle East problem is the
establishment of an independent state of Palestine, safe borders
between Israel and Palestine, safe cooperation in all fields
between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Jerusalem should be the
safe capital of the two peoples, Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. and other countries to put pressure on Israel
to implement all agreements it signed with the PNA.
