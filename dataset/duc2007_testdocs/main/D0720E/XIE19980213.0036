<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Warning Against Collapse of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In a stern warning to
Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the
intifada (uprising) if the peace process collapses.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to
mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat
renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence
in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence
of a final peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said "the Palestinian people do not
remember the painful experience to cry, but to renew our
commitment to our national goal - the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital." He
said that those who oppose the Palestinian move to achieve
independence "can drink from the Gaza Sea or Dead Sea."
</P>
<P>
Afrafat stressed that he was ready to die in order to put East
Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, in the Palestinian
hands.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is hoping to establish an independent state with
East Jerusalem as its capital, a move opposed by Israel which has
declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing the suffering of the Palestinians in the past,
Arafat paid tributes to the bravery of his people who have
carried on the longest revolution of this century. He added that
the Palestinians will continue to stay on their land and nothing,
even nuclear, biological and other weapons, will force them to
leave.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's warning came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay
in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed in
January, 1997, Israel should have finished the first two
stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last
year. But Israel has delayed the move due to the dispute over the
scope of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the stalemate, the United States is
currently hosting Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in
Washington to bridge the gap. But no breakthrough has been
achieved so far, as the Palestinian side has turned down a
U.S. proposal on a 13 percent withdrawal in the second
redeployment, which is to be implemented in two phases according
to the PNA's fulfillment of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony kicked off a series of events in the
coming year to mark the so-called "Catastrophe" -- the forced
mass exudos of Palestinians in 1948. Over 3 million Palestinians
have been forced to exile since Israel won the 1948
independence war and occupied a large part of the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities is a proposed international conference of
all countries which have suffered similar disaster to discuss the
Palestinian catastrophe. A committee in charge of the
commemorative activities will also establish a museum to document
modern Palestinian history, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian news
service Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported.
