<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns Arafat not to Declare Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to
declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before meeting with foreign diplomats here
on Wednesday afternoon, Netanyahu said the peace process could be
moved forward if Arafat refrains from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could
collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he
wins in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that he has the right
to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year,
when the five-year transitional period under Oslo expires.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization Central Council is
discussing in Gaza whether to declare statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration,
threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
The peace process could only be moved forward through
negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could
help.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution
adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in
Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the
basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The commission's resolution also calls for the right of
Palestinian refugees to return home.
