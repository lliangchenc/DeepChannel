   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators passed quietly Saturday in Myanmar
without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of
a resolution of the country's deepening problems.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and a government official said there were no
demonstrations, after warnings from the government and a reported
call for calm by the opposition party, the National League for
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove past some key points this morning, including the
university and the NLD office and I didn't see any additional riot
police or troops or any additional security measures anywhere,''
said a diplomat in the Burmese capital of Yangon, once known as
Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
   A statement faxed to The Associated Press said: ``There are no
demonstrations in Yangon or anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the anniversary passed quietly, there could be stepped-up
activity in the coming two weeks by the opposition, led by Daw Aung
San Suu Kyi. She has set Aug. 21 as the deadline for convening the
National Assembly, which was elected eight years ago in a vote that
was annulled by the military after her party won 80 percent of its
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the military rulers have systematically harassed and
imprisoned the elected opposition members and their supporters, and
have choked off any attempts at public protest.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing student unrest, authorities have closed the country's
universities for almost eight of the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Wiedemann, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, said the
opposition was ``clearly taking the initiative at this moment'' in
an effort to force some liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a principle involved: yes, they want to have the
election finally recognized,'' Wiedemann said of the Aug. 21
deadline. But practically speaking, he said, the immediate goal of
the opposition is to bring the country's leaders into talks.
</P>
<P>
   The military leaders have said repeatedly that they are only
caretakers and that they want to make a transition to democracy.
But their refusal to honor the results of the 1990 election has
raised questions about their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   And they have shown no sign of softening. ``As you can see,
looking at the events of the last week, the government, rather than
heeding the call for dialogue, is instead adopting a more
confrontational attitude,'' Wiedemann said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to stepped-up harassment of the opposition party's
elected members of Parliament, the stifling of public protest and
the forced return of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to her home on Wednesday
after she was halted attempting to visit party members outside
Yangon, and in a standoff spent six days in her car.
