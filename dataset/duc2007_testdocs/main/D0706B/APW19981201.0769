Myanmar bars British officials

	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar has barred British ministers and officials
from the country following British pressure on the military regime
to hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in
Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter
the country, also known as Burma.
	   Last month, Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett called for a
European Union mission, including Britain, to visit Myanmar in an
attempt to improve human rights in the country, which has been
under military rule since 1962.
	   Britain also discourages companies from putting new investment
into Myanmar.
	   ``I regret this move by the Burmese regime,'' Fatchett said
Tuesday. ``It will in no way dissuade us from continuing to work
for an improvement in the human rights and the political situation
in Burma and bringing pressure on the regime to enter into dialogue
with democratic leaders.''
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked
in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over
demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened. Her National
League for Democracy won the elections, but the military never
allowed Parliament to meet.
	   The EU has already placed sanctions on the Myanmar regime
including an arms embargo, putting restrictions on visas and
suspending non-humanitarian aid.
	   ``The visa ban is an acknowledgment that the U.K. is at the
forefront of international action to bring pressure on the Burmese
regime to improve the human rights and political situation in
Burma,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said anonymously, in keeping
with British practice.
