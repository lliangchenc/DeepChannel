   &UR;  &LR; To do business overseas, especially in cudgel-wielding
dictatorships, the savvy executive adopts a three-point strategy:
1) See No Evil, 2) Hear No Evil, 3) Speak No Evil. In the spirit of
this philosophy, I present today in my capacity as chairman of the
billion-dollar multinational Make a Buck at Any Cost Corp. my
special report on American Business Sentiment Toward Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with the government's own view of life in this
Southeast Asian paradise of more than 47 million people. In the
words of the ruling junta, Burma is one of the most pleasant places
created by Mother Nature. I couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anti-business fanatics delight in squawking about the
occasional tiffs between the people of Burma and their military
rulers. Yes, Rangoon cracked down on protests in 1988, killing
thousands to restore order. Yes, the government ignored results of
an election in 1990 clearly indicating that 90 percent of the
people rejected its rule and wanted democracy. And, yes, it placed
the elected victor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi,
under house arrest. Yes, many of Suu Kyi's party members have been
killed, jailed, or forced into exile. Yes, the rulers practice
torture, turn a blind eye to slavery, and traffick in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any concern of ours? As long as imprisonments, torture,
slavery, and political repression don't hinder business, let's not
get in a huff about it. These spats will work themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   I will say just one thing to those who whine about human rights:
We will battle all attempts to impose on us a social conscience.
Are we in business to save the world or make a profit? Lately, I'm
pleased to report, we've seen some progress in silencing the
wild-eyed whiners.
</P>
<P>
   Right here in Massashusetts, we finally crushed a radical law
late last year that bans state contracts with companies doing
business with Burma. We applaud the clever logic of the National
Foreign Trade Council, which took the battle into the courts on
behalf of its 580 corporate members. The judge, in his wisdom,
agreed with the council that the state law was unconstitutional. Of
course! What right does Massachusetts, or any state, have to make
its own foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner did we lop off the head of this human rights demon
than another beast sprung up in its place. A month after the
Massachusetts law was struck down, the Los Angeles city council
voted unanimously to enact a similar ban on the municipal level.
</P>
<P>
   If only these were the few isolated attacks on us. But more than
two dozen other states and cities are discussing or have already
passed laws that target trade with not only Burma but other
promising markets like Nigeria, Indonesia, and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Already some companies have retreated from Burma on moral
grounds. It breaks my heart. If a company must withdraw, it is far
better to do it proudly for manly businesslike reasons _ not from
any moral squeamishness.
</P>
<P>
   Let us all hail Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant.
It ended operations in Burma last year because of threats of a
worldwide consumer boycott. The company stated in unequivocal terms
that its decision was not based on ethics _ it was, as it should
be, purely a commercial move.
