<HEADLINE> Britain Wants to See Turkey at London Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The British ambassador to Turkey
Thursday indirectly expressed the hope that Turkey could
participate in the European Union (EU) meeting scheduled for March
in London, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey can profit from "some substantial profits" provided by
the EU, David Logan told a press conference here, which was
jointly held with EU representative in Ankara, Michel Lake.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the present bitter relations between Turkey and
EU, Logan noted that Ankara should not negatively evaluate the
Luxembourg summit last December from an overall point of view.
</P>
<P>
He, however said that he understands Turkey's frustration over
the EU decisions.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders excluded Turkey from the ranks of the
prospective candidates for the EU expansion process during the
summit, smashing Turkey's dream of becoming full EU member state
in this century.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Turkey announced a halt of political dialog
with the European body to protest its "discriminative attitude"
toward the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Britain, which holds the term
presidency of the EU, hopes it can persuade Turkey to attend the
London meeting which deals with the EU accession issues.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Lake said that maintaining a good relationship is
in accordance with the economic interests of both Turkey and the
EU.
</P>
<P>
"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in
Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said,
referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite its compliant over the Luxembourg decision, Turkey has
made it very clear that it would continue to develop economic
cooperation with the 15 EU nations.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the largest trade partner of Turkey with traditional
links.
</P>
<P>
Turkey submitted its formal application for the EU membership
in 1987, but so far the goal has not been achieved due to its
various differences with the EU, such as on human rights, economic
problems as well as the Cyprus issue.
