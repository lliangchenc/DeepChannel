Turkey praises EU decision on candidacy

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said
the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for
membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels
and Ankara.
	   ``Although wrong assessments by the European Union persist, with
the definition of Turkey by the European Commission as one of the
12 candidate countries, the road toward developing our relations
has opened,'' Minister Ismail Cem said in a statement.
	   After the decision in December to exclude Turkey from the first
wave of enlargement talks, Turkey put its relations with the
15-member union on hold. Since then, the EU has been trying to
patch up the relationship, with several leaders of member countries
insisting that Turkey's place is in the union.
	   The European Commission released Thursday its first set of
regular reports assessing the progress towards EU membership of 12
candidate countries, including 10 central and eastern European
countries and Cyprus and Turkey.
	   The EU ambassador to Turkey, Karen Fogg, insisted that the
report ``did not signal a new status of Turkey, but the
confirmation that Turkey is a candidate country.''
	   In any case, the report indicated Turkish membership would not
come soon.
	   ``The persistent violations of human rights and important
deficiencies in the treatment of minorities are causes of
concern,'' the report on Turkey stated.
	   Turkish authorities are frequently accused of systematically
violating human rights, especially in the southeast where Kurdish
rebels have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.
	   The Commission also criticized the lack of civilian control over
the military, which plays a central role in the country's political
life.
	   The report praised Turkey's economic policy but said it still
had a long way to go in the adoption of EU legal and administrative
standards.
