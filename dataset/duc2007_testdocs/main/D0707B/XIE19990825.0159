<HEADLINE> EU Considering New Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is
considering granting a second emergency aid to quake-stricken
Turkey as senior officials of the bloc are scheduled to visit the
country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, whose country is
serving the rotating presidency of the European Union, and
European Union Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek
are to meet in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
They are to assess the damage caused by the August 17
earthquake, which has so far claimed a death toll of more than 12,
000 people in northwestern Turkey, and plans of EU's aid to
rehabilitate and reconstruct the devastated region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the EU granted a 2-million-euro (2.06 million U.S.
dollar) emergency aid to Turkey. The European Commission is to
discuss on Thursday the granting of a second aid package which is
said to be similar in amount to the first one.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is also to discuss in September a more
elaborate action plan to support Turkey, whose relationship with
the union went awry after the union stopped short of letting it
join the grouping among the first batch of countries.
