<HEADLINE> Turkey Hails EU Statement on Ankara's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed a statement
by the European Union (EU), which confirmed the perspective of
Turkey's full membership to the group.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of
Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for
Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
She said her country would make new efforts toward full EU
membership. "Our struggle will start from now on," she said.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement was issued Sunday at the end of a meeting of
EU foreign ministers in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. It said
that Turkey was recognized as having a European future and it
would be treated in the same way as others seeking the EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
The statement came following a March 4 statement by the EU
Christian Democrats which called Turkey's membership application
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years
and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it
was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full
membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey currently has a customs union agreement with the EU,
which removed some trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has also expressed his
satisfaction over the EU message, saying that "Turkey's European
horizon has been opened."
