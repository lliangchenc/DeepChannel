<HEADLINE> European Parliament Accused of Freezing Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey tonight accused the
European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said: "It is
impossible for us to accept the contents and the reasons of the
decision made by the European Parliament related to the scheduled
aid to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
" Like its decision on September 19, 1996, the European
Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation
between Turkey and the European Union (EU)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the EU member states to show their " necessary
reactions to this preventive attitude of the European Parliament."
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights
record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of
U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the European Parliament voted to review
substantial financing for Turkey from the EU's MEDA Program,
through which up to 842 million ECUs was envisaged for the bloc's
Mediterranean neighbors in 1997.
