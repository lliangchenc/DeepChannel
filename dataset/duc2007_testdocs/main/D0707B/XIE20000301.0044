<HEADLINE> EU, Turkey Meet on Accession Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and Turkey
have met here to discuss the latter's prospect of accession to the
15-nation western bloc, the European Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral meeting, held Tuesday between EU Economy and
Finance Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira and Turkish Economy
Minister Recep Onal, reviewed the fact that Turkey had initiated
an economic stability program in order to decrease inflation and
increase economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Both Solbes and Onal expressed their willingness to initiate a
dialogue in the economic and monetary fields between the European
Union and Turkey that was included in the accession list only last
December.
</P>
<P>
The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented
achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the
importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey
during the pre-accession period.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European
Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in
December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the European Union decided
last December in Helsinki to include Turkey in its list of
accession that already includes Poland, the Czech Republic ,
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Bulgaria and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The EU has started official accession negotiations with the 12
countries but did not do the same with Turkey. Some EU member
states have been criticizing the human rights record of the
country that strides over two continents. Turkey is a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
