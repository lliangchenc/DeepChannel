<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Turkey to Become Candidate for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see
neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU)
membership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey
as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not
overlook the fact that the neighboring country had
responsibilities and obligations.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey was ready to undertake these responsibilities, Greece
had no objection to helping, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also consistently blocked the more than 1-billion
U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that it supports Turkey in its
efforts to join EU but the condition is that Ankara must improve
its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To ease its tense relations with Turkey, Greece will in the
near future partially lift its veto on EU funding for Turkey after
the devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which has
claimed thousands of lives.
