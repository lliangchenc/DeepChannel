ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) can no
longer put off the question of Turkey's possible entrance into the
continent-wide union, said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
Tuesday.

<P>
Talking with the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Dini said the
EU will have to "recognize Turkey's right to bear the title of
candidate of the union" at its December meeting in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister added that in the face of the
recent devastating earthquake in Turkey, the EU "cannot further
delay the choice" for Ankara.

<P>
"In light of the recent tragedies, the economy of a great
Mediterranean country is at risk," Dini told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union, without renouncing its principles," will
have to decide in December to allow Turkey to become a formal
candidate for EU membership.
