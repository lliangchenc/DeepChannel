Turkey demands formal recognition for EU membership
</HEADLINE>

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Wednesday it wants the
European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its
summit later this week.
	   ``Turkey's expectancy is that its candidacy be approved and
confirmed legally,'' Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli
told reporters.
	   He added that Turkish officials were spurning an invitation to a
summit dinner because Turkey wasn't a candidate.
	   Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the
union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of
Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with
Greece.
	   An enlargement report for the Dec. 11-12 summit in Vienna
includes Turkey among the 11 countries negotiating membership, but
the list does not make it a candidate. Atacanli said the document
``is far from meeting Turkey's expectations.''
