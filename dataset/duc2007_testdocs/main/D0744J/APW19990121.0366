	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Farmers upset by the overly broad  
label of ``organic'' foods may find relief later this year with an 
expected government ruling that will limit the kinds of foods 
receiving that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to  
protect the integrity of your industry,'' Keith Jones of the 
Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program told farmers 
at the Ecological Farming Conference on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label  
``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered 
or treated with antibiotics. The new labeling plan responds to an 
outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the 
farmers considered too permissive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob  
Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is a 
member of the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of 
organic farmers. ``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the 
government's attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department is developing the first national standards on  
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and 
industry guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually  
for the last seven years. In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms  
trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming 
Research Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call  
organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,  
herbicides or preservatives. Livestock should be raised in open-air 
environments, without antibiotics or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the USDA proposed allowing food to be labeled  
``organic'' even if it was irradiated to kill germs, genetically 
engineered, or subjected to sewage sludge. The rules also would 
have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited 
by industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000  
protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
withdraw the proposal and try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers at the conference remained skeptical that his  
verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but  
we still believe in it. That's kind of where we are in this 
process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for 
Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,''  
said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a 
Santa Fe, N.M. company. ``For many of us, this is a continuation of 
a lifetime of work. First it was civil rights. Then it was 
anti-war. Now it's food security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules will probably be published this summer in the  
Federal Register and could take effect in the fall, said Jones.
