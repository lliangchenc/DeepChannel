   NEW YORK _ Readers often send me questions that are of interest
to more than an audience of one, and lately they have almost all
involved fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   One reader was anxious about the pesticides in strawberries, and
whether cooking the fruit reduced any risk. I checked the most
recent ranking of produce by the Environmental Working Group, a
nonprofit research organization in Washington. The rankings reflect
the number of pesticides in various fruits and vegetables, and the
percentage of each category that is cantaminated with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Apples were at the top, followed by spinach, peaches, pears,
strawberries, Chilean grapes, potatoes, red raspberries, celery and
green beans.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether cooking reduces the levels of pesticide in a
fruit or vegetable, it depends on the type of fruit or vegetable
and on how long it is cooked. Turning apples into applesauce or
tomatoes into tomato paste reduces levels significantly. Freezing
produce has virtually no impact.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wondered if peeling vegetables reduced the
pesticide level. Generally, peeling fruits and vegetables will
reduce the level, but some pesticides are systemic and taken up
through the roots.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in more data on pesticides in food can log on
to the Web site of the Environmental Working Group, which is at
www.foodnews.org. For those who are truly concerned about
pesticides in conventional food, the safest alternative is organic
food.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, a reader wondered about the nutritional value
of vegetables in soup, explaining that her husband called soup
``dead vegetables'' because they are cooked so long. Water-soluble
vitamins B and C do leach out of vegetables when they are cooked in
liquid, but in this case they go directly into the soup.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the vegetables from looking dead, add the most tender
ones just long enough to cook and contribute some flavor without
turning to mush.
</P>
<P>
   Still another reader wanted to know how pineapple juice and
carrot juice can still have fiber in them after they have been
processed. The best source of that kind of information is Harold
McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   As he explains, there are two kinds of fiber, soluble and
insoluble. Pectin, which is used to gel jellies, is soluble fiber.
It doesn't appear to have any texture, but it does, so you might
not be able to tell it was in the juice. Cellulose and lignin are
insoluble fibers. The fiber in a glass of pineapple or carrot juice
is soluble, and it cannot be seen because it is suspended in the
liquid. Insoluble fiber, if it is there, is the sediment, what
eventually falls to the bottom of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader had a more pressing question: Can you make a
low-fat blue cheese dressing like the bottled kind at home?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. You can make a low-fat blue cheese dressing, but not
like the one in the bottle. In my version, which is given below,
there is no guar gum, used as a thickener.
</P>
<P>
   Because blue cheese has such a strong flavor, not much is
needed, and that keeps the calories and fat down. This dressing is
delicious on ripe tomatoes or Belgian endive and as an alternative
to the usual dressing for coleslaw or potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   To make enough for four people, mash two ounces (four
tablespoons) of blue cheese with six tablespoons of plain nonfat
yogurt, two tablespoons of brandy and a couple of pinches of
cayenne. Mix well. The dressing will keep for a week or two in the
refrigerator, tightly covered.
