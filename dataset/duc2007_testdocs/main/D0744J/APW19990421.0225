	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a marriage aimed at putting fish on the  
table of the world's rich and poor for generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
	With research showing that global fish stocks are vanishing,  
business and industry are joining forces with environmental groups 
to back a new seal of approval -- for fish caught from waters where 
they will be replenished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of saving fish so we can eat them,''  
said British lawmaker John Gummer, chairman of the Marine 
Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit organization which 
unveiled the seal and announced the first independent global 
standard to certify fisheries on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, about  
60 percent of the world's 200 most valuable fish species are either 
depleted, overfished or only slowly recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Some species, such as the Atlantic halibut and the bluefin tuna,  
have been fished to the brink of extinction. The spawning of 
bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic has fallen by nearly 90 
percent since 1975, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
	A large quality bluefin can fetch as much as $30,000 dockside,  
it added. At the Tsukigi fish market in Japan, the bluefin can go 
for the $60,000 and cost $200 a plate at the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim of the council's campaign, which already has backing  
from more than 200 corporate, government and voluntary 
organizations around the world, is to get ``market power behind the 
battle to save our fishing stocks,'' Gummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council hopes the seal -- a line drawing of a fish whose back  
and tail fin are shaped like an approving check mark -- will bolster 
consumer demand for fish that are being replenished, Gummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turquoise-and-white logo will begin to appear later this  
year in Europe and North America on fish products, restaurant 
menus, and advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Gummer announced the first American companies to sign on --  
Boston-based Legal Sea Foods, a seafood processor and restaurant 
company, and Shaw's Supermarkets which has 127 stores in the six 
New England States. Whole Foods Market Inc., based in Austin, 
Texas, which has 92 stores around the country selling gourmet and 
organic food, also signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fish supply is no longer sustainable, then Legal Sea  
Foods as a business is no longer sustainable,'' said Roger 
Berkowitz, the company's president and chief executive officer. 
``We can't suddenly switch gears and sell poultry or meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based council was the brainchild of Unilever, one of  
the world's largest buyers of frozen fish, and the World Wide Fund 
for Nature, who wanted to bring together public and private-sector 
efforts to reverse the crisis from overfishing and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the council was established in 1997, he said, it has  
consulted fishermen and experts around the world to come up with a 
global standard for fisheries that will augment existing local, 
national and international laws, standards and agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	To receive council certification, fisheries must be  
well-managed, maintain and replenish healthy fish stocks, and 
preserve the surrounding ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	The council will accredit specialist organizations or commercial  
companies to independently certify that fisheries meet their 
standards -- and ensure that they continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be certifying quality fish caught in a way which  
doesn't endanger future fishing,'' Gummer said.
