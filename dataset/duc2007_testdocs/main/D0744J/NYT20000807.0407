ABC TO CORRECT REPORT THAT CHALLENGED BENEFITS OF ORGANIC FOODS 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ ABC News said Monday that a report challenging the
assumed benefits of organic food was partly based on research that
did not exist. It said it would make a correction on Friday night's
``20/20'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said research
commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not
necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the
conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report first
broadcast on Feb. 4 and again on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing
_ Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia,
and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and
Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never
tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday night, ABC confirmed that
pesticide tests were never performed on produce. But it steered
blame away from Stossel. ``In making that statement, Mr. Stossel
was relying on inaccurate information that had been provided to
him,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said David Fitzpatrick, producer of the segment, was
responsible for the error, and they were trying to determine how it
appeared. But, they said, they believed it was an honest mistake
and did not think Fitzpatrick would be disciplined. Stossel will
make the correction.
</P>
<P>
   Top ABC News executives began looking into potential problems
with the report two weeks ago, after The New York Times addressed
them in an article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the first time the issue had been raised with ABC
News. Problems with the report were first brought to light by the
members of the Environmental Working Group, which supports the
consumption of organic food. They had learned that Stossel's
assertion about the pesticide tests was in error after speaking
with the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   They apprised Stossel of their findings in a letter dated Feb.
8. They were answered by Fitzpatrick, who, in a letter, asserted
that ABC did, indeed, test produce for pesticide residue. After the
report was rerun, Stossel re-emphasized the pesticide assertion in
an on-the-air conversation with Cynthia McFadden, a ``20/20''
anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, said they were trying
to determine why the group's assertion about the supposed pesticide
tests was not properly addressed when it was first raised.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group also contended that Stossel's
report had inappropriately implied that ABC's tests had detected
dangerous strains of E. coli bacteria in the organic food when, in
fact, the tests did not establish the presence of the dangerous
type of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said they were still looking into that accusation.
