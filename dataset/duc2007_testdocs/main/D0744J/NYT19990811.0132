   Back then, it was a political statement; today, it's a health
statement. Middle age and affluence are hitting baby boomers at the
same time, benefiting the all-natural-food industry. Organics and
natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers remember granola and yogurt and herbal teas from their
college hippie days. And although whole foods have long had a place
with the Birkenstocks and mantra crowd, today's consumer is more
likely to drive a Suburban than a VW bus.
</P>
<P>
   Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream
supermarkets. And the meaning of ``natural'' has morphed to include
exotics: cheeses, butters and fish and varieties of vegetables we
only read about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Older, more sophisticated shoppers want to buy Saint Johnswort,
but they also want to buy triple cream St. Andre cheese. Younger
shoppers who can afford it also want it both ways: hip and
healthful.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sales of organic and all-natural foods have grown by 15
percent to 25 percent annually for the past seven years. Today,
more than 10,000 U.S. farms produce organic/natural crops and
livestock, according to the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
And these products are being snapped up by consumers who, in the
main, make more than $50,000 a year and are 45 and older, according
to SPINS, an independent natural-products information source.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheerios maker General Mills rolls out an organic option to
all those sugar-pumped floaters, you know organic groceries are
going mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise Cereal slipped into the General Mills tide this summer,
and it won't be the last of its kind, at least in marketing trials.
</P>
<P>
   The steady growth of the organic market isn't the near
panic-driven demand generated in the 1980s by a string of
food-safety scares that included actress Meryl Streep on ``60
Minutes'' challenging the use of alar, a ripening agent. That event
led to near disaster for the apple industry.
</P>
<P>
   And although the growth of the market is consistent, organics
still represent a small fraction of grocery sales in the country,
at least in part because of their higher prices: Whereas an
increasing organic supply has narrowed the price gap between
organic and conventional fare, the difference in price remains
large enough to favor higher-income shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, grocers see a gradual greening in the diet of the
American consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two to three years, momentum has begun to build in
the organic food area,'' Tom Thumb spokeswoman Connie Yates said in
a prepared statement. ``Sales of organic foods in all categories
are definitely on the increase. By the year 2001, organic products
are projected to command 5 percent of total food sales in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness is what's rising,'' said Doug White, produce
director for Minyard Food Stores' three chains: Minyard, Carnival
and Sack'N Save.
</P>
<P>
   None of the mainstream supermarkets has matched the
certified-organic and all-natural inventory found at specialty
stores such as Austin-based Whole Foods Markets, the nation's No. 1
natural-foods chain, or Boulder, Colo.-based Wild Oats Markets, or
H.E. Butt Grocery Co.'s three Central Market stores in Austin and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Among mainstream grocers, Tom Thumb based in Dallas was once the
Metroplex leader for certified organic produce and all-natural
alternatives, and Yates said its storewide organics variety has
continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's, already the Metroplex leader in overall grocery
market share, has more recently taken the mainstream lead for
adding varieties and carrying consistent supplies. The Boise,
Idaho-based chain's certified-organic and all-natural lineups
include fresh produce, dried spices, canned and frozen foods, dairy
items, snacks and other packaged items, and meats and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   And Kroger's Southwest division has been revving up its own
reformation _ adding 16- to 24-foot sections devoted to certified
organic produce in 44 of its 62 Metroplex supermarkets since spring
1998, said Gary Huddleston, division consumer affairs manager.
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of competitors, Kroger is also
carrying ``additive-free'' or ``all-natural'' lines of beef,
chicken and pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organic baby foods is one category doing extremely well,''
Huddleston said, citing both nonrefrigerated versions and a new
frozen line of certified organic baby foods.
</P>
<P>
   The New Organics Co. based in Massachusetts has also been
gradually capturing space on the canned and packaged grocery aisles
of many area supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie Texas based in Fort Worth, for example, is stocking
New Organics mustards, preserves and other canned and packaged
foods in 45 of its 73 Texas and Oklahoma stores, said Pat West,
Winn-Dixie's regional marketing director.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The surge of organic foods into mainstream markets in North
Texas can be explained in large part because of increasing numbers
of suppliers: more demand, more supply.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more and more categories of organic and natural foods
are becoming widely available, said Jeff Lang, Albertson's North
Texas Division grocery sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years ago, Albertson's ``organic'' merchandising
amounted to a few selected stores featuring maybe three to eight
certified organic items in 4-foot spaces dwarfed by the produce
departments. Today, each Albertson's store _ including 113 in its
North Texas Division _ carries a minimum of 25 certified organic
produce items, and many locations offer 38 to 45, said Gary
Barnett, the division's produce sales manager. Those items are
dispersed throughout the produce department rather than being
relegated to a solitary corner. In fact, all of Albertson's organic
items are scattered throughout the store rather than being
segregated into an organics section, flagged by signs identifying
them as organic.
</P>
<P>
   Minyard's White notes that his stores are just beginning to show
a similar burgeoning variety of whole foods. Although supply and
demand vary widely from store to store, some locations in the
Minyard chain carry as many as 30 to 40 certified organic produce
items, as well as increasing organic options in canned, frozen and
dairy foods.
</P>
<P>
   The grocer, based in Coppell, Texas, is even stocking some
organic produce that has yet to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking toward the future,'' White said of the chain's
commitment to organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Which seems fairly natural.
