   NEW YORK _ There was a time, not too long ago, when you were a
fine pet owner as long as you fed your pet table scraps or chow,
took it to the vet when necessary, and maybe bought a latex toy for
it to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you would border on negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The pet owner of today, according to a growing number of
health-conscious animal lovers, should provide organic food,
nutritional supplements, interactive toys and videos, and holistic
remedies such as acupuncture, massage and aromatherapy. Over the
past 15 years or so, an entire industry has sprung up to supply
organic nutrition and holistic care to pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarket pet food is full of crap,'' says Norma Otero, the
manager at Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, a 13-year-old store in the
East Village. ``Would you want to eat road kill and factory
byproducts? Why would you give that to your pet? Even a human can
eat my food.'' Whiskers sells organic, all-natural pet foods. The
list of ingredients on any package of food reads like a regular
grocery list: chicken, corn, carrots ... There are no chemical
ingredients ending in ``-ide'' or ``-ate,'' which appear frequently
on most of the lists on most processed pet foods.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding a pet those processed foods all the time ``is like
giving your kid Trix versus Grape Nuts or Cheerios,'' says Amy
Shapiro, owner of two natural pet stores, the eight-year-old
Barking Zoo in Chelsea and the newly opened Another Barking Zoo in
Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for natural pets disagree about premium brands
such as Iams and Hill's Science Diet. Barking Zoos carry them, but
Whiskers does not, because they are processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do OK with that food,'' says Dr. Roger Valentine, a Los
Angeles veterinarian who specializes in cats. ``But when people
switch to those premium brands after having their cat on organic
food, the cats get dandruff and loose stools and hairballs and
things like that.'' But Valentine says there is not enough data to
say that cats on organic food are actually living longer.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Strazdin, manager of public relations for Iams Co., isn't
persuaded, either. ``We have not seen any studies that show organic
foods are better than non-organic,'' she says. ``If we did see
that, then honestly, we would switch.'' Iams is processed, but it
considers itself all-natural, because it has no artificial
preservatives, no color or flavor enhancers, and no salt or sugar.
Officials at Hill's Pet Nutrition, maker of Science Diet, did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the conscientious pet owner has to consider much
more than food.
</P>
<P>
   Owners also have an array of pet vitamins and food supplements
to choose from, which aid digestion, improve the health of skin and
fur, repel pests and prevent urinary, kidney and liver problems.
There are special foods for pets with injuries, diabetes, allergies
or weak immune systems, and heart, kidney or gastrointestinal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous growth in the industry in the last
10-15 years,'' says Shapiro. ``So many people are inventing new
products and gadgets. More people are finding that the pet market
is a viable marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the success of this market is braced by the strong
economy. More Americans than ever can afford extras for their pets.
In addition, people have grown more knowledgeable and open to
healthy living and alternative medicine in general. But the biggest
boon to the pet industry may be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net has done wonders,'' Shapiro says. As people have gone
online to research their own health and alternative medicines in
particular, pet owners have also educated themselves about pet-care
options on hundreds of informational Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many pet stores now have online outlets, so for people who don't
live near a Whiskers or a Barking Zoo, natural pet supplies are
just several clicks away. But while the Internet has helped build
awareness and a customer base for natural pet supplies, some store
owners see a downside. Shapiro says she appreciates the added
business from her online customers, but worries that independent
pet stores are getting squeezed out by big online outlets such as
pets.com and petopia.com.
</P>
<P>
   The local stores have one important advantage. Pets and owners
can visit them on their walks. Inside, people can see how certain
products go over with their pets before buying. Aside from the
myriad food choices, there are organic bones and treats as an
alternative to rawhide, which Otero says is difficult to digest and
contains bleach and glue. There is a cat litter, World's Best, made
from 100 percent kernel corn, which is recommended because it is
flushable and the cat will digest it easily if it licks the litter
off its paws afterward. There are books and videos on alternative
pet therapies, such as acupuncture, Chinese and Western herbology,
massage, aromatherapy, color therapy and homeopathy.
</P>
<P>
   So how much will it cost you to become a natural pet owner? A
lot. A seven-pound bag of World's Best cat litter costs more than
twice as much as the more mainstream Fresh Step at the Barking
Zoos. A 13-ounce can of organic dog food costs up to $3.99 at
Whiskers, while a same-sized can of Friskies' Alpo costs 69 cents
at RiteAid.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, ``It may be more expensive, but your pet is
healthier and happier, and you'll spend less at the vet,'' says
Shapiro, who owns a greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   Customers agree. ``It's a big expense,'' admits Noel Canfield,
who has shopped for her seven cats at Whiskers ever since it
opened. She used to buy processed cat food, but after she lost a
cat to cancer, she started studying what was in the food and
switched to organic. ``It's been worth it because no one's been
really sick in my cat family,'' she said. ``It boosts their immune
system. I'm a nurse, and I feel like I'm being a good parent, if
you will.'' In addition, she says, organic food looks and smells
better.
</P>
<P>
   After all, money spent on pets is really spent on owners. People
see pets as benefits to their own health. Recent studies say pets
lower stress and blood pressure. Some hospitals are even using
pet-facilitated therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are valuing animals more than ever, and want to take
care of them,'' says Canfield. ``I want them to be around as long
as possible.''
