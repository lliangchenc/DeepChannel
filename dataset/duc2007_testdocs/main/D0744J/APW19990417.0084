	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers once could find organic food  
products only in specialty stores. Today, with more organic choices 
than ever, from beef to baby food, and with more markets stocking 
the goods, organic is going mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores are selling meats and poultry products carrying organic  
labels, which the Agriculture Department approved in January. Last 
month, food giant General Mills introduced its organic cereal, 
Sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic vegetables and fruits, already well known to consumers,  
now are being used in a variety of products, including baby food. 
</P>
<P>
	For years organic foods were bit players in the food industry.  
The growing number of organic offerings, supporters say, shows a 
mainstream acceptance -- and a victory for farmers, merchants and 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last few years, when you talk about organic, usually  
it's lettuce, vegetables, fruit,'' said Bob Scowcroft, executive 
director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You devote your life to this and it's just hard to envision.  
... Overnight, it's the ad in the middle of the evening news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the organic industry is growing at least 20 percent  
each year in the last five years, with overall 1997 sales of about 
$4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased demand has caught the attention of the estimated  
5,300 farmers growing organic products, Scowcroft said. Each day, 
his office hears from dozens of farmers wanting information about 
making the transition to organic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quantity that General Mills is buying and their projected  
expansion . . . shows up on the radar screen (for farmers),'' 
Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Sunrise cereal contains organic whole wheat, corn, oats  
and barley as well as organic sugar, said Scott Lutz, vice 
president for new enterprises at General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the bigger challenges was to make sure there was an  
ample supply of organic grains and organic sugar,'' Lutz said. The 
company spent about four years developing the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction has been very positive,'' Lutz said. ``We've been  
hearing from consumers for quite some time that they wanted another 
choice. We tried to make organic cereals accessible to the 
mainstream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will also benefit from the introduction of organic  
meat in stores across the country, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Organically-grown meat typically comes from animals that have  
been fed vegetarian diets free of pesticides, fertilizers and 
antibiotics. The animals are also free range, meaning they are able 
to roam and are not confined to small pens that sometimes house 
hundreds of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a much-anticipated announcement, Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman in January said the agency would allow meat to be 
certified and labeled as organic. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the industry had complained that it was unfair to allow  
vegetables, fruits and milk to be labeled organic, while placing 
restraints on the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
	California-based Petaluma Poultry, which has marketed  
antibiotic-free chicken for several years, plans to introduce its 
Rosie the Organic Chicken next week to consumers in California, 
Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based company that has marketed  
vegetables and milk, already offers frozen hot dogs and hamburger 
patties. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Organic Valley plans to introduce the first organic  
bacon and ham as well as whole organic chicken and chicken breasts. 
A line of sausage products is expected in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh products first will be marketed in the Midwest while  
the frozen items will be distributed nationally, said Theresa 
Marquez, Organic Valley's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Shainsky, president of Petaluma Poultry, said if the  
growth of his company's antibiotic-free chicken line is any 
indication of what is in store for organic, the industry should do 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the reaction to our antibiotic free business become  
bigger and bigger,'' Shainsky said. ``You hear how everyone wants 
organic. We'll see how well we're received.''
