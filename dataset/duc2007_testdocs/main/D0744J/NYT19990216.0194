   Dennis T. Avery wants organic food to go away. And he doesn't
care what it takes. Four years ago, he said that organic food could
not feed the world without destroying the environment. Now, he says
it's lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine,
published by his employer, the Hudson Institute, a conservative
research group, Avery wrote, ``Organic foods have clearly become
the deadliest food choice.'' This is the case, he said, because
organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit
pasteurization. The last assertion is untrue, as were several other
statements in the article.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation might have gone unnoticed, but excerpts from the
article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to
be picked up around the country, by The Associated Press, The Tampa
Tribune and trade industry publications.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest definition of ``organic'' is food grown without
hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Avery, however, used
the terms ``organic,'' ``free-range,'' ``natural'' and
``unpasteurized'' interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grant you that I've mixed together natural and organic,''
Avery, the author of ``Saving the Planet With Pesticides and
Plastic'' (Hudson Institute, 1995), said in an interview last week.
``But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in
terms of public health.''
</P>
<P>
   His most combative accusation is based, he said, on 1996 data
compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing
that ``people who eat organic and `natural' foods are eight times
as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly
new strain of E. coli bacteria (O157:H7).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak, which he called
organic, were not, like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   Avery's claim that ``consumers of organic food are also more
likely to be attacked by a relatively new, more virulent strain of
the infamous salmonella bacteria'' was based on a Consumers Union
study in 1998 showing that ``premium'' chickens had higher levels
of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens. But the premium
chickens were not organic.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to
task for failing ``to issue any warnings to consumers about the
higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in
organic foods.'' In the interview, he said that that assertion was
based on a statement by Dr. Robert Lake, an official in the
agency's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Lake denied making such a statement, saying, ``We don't go out
of our way to sample organic food, and hence I don't think we are
in a position to say anything one way or another about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery wrote that because ``organic farmers use animal manure as
the major source of fertilizer,'' there are higher levels of
harmful bacteria in organic food. Katherine DiMatteo, the executive
director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not
the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in
conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must
be followed for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer
safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7.'' His real goal, he
said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed
ourselves organically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on organic food by a well-financed research
organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for
only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food
industry is worried.
