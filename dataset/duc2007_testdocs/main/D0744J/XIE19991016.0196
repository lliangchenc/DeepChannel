The concept of organic food -- products grown in the optimal
ecological environment and subject to a thorough quality control
process -- first appeared in China ten years ago. Products and
processes are standardized and trademarked to protect consumers.

Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in
China's agriculture and food production. The total output of China
's organic food was up to 8.4 million tons by the end of 1998. The
sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan (about 3.3
billion US dollars).

The rapid development of China's organic food industry has
attracted the international attention. In 1998, the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United
Nations emphasized China's experiences of development and
management of organic food in the Asia-Pacific region.

Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu
Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with
great potential. It is estimated that in the coming years, the
scale of the world's organic food market will reach 100 billion US
dollars and Europe, the United States and Japan will take the lead.

In China, the average consumption of fruit and vegetables is
still far behind that of developed countries, thus it has a good
opportunity to develop organic food, Liu said.
