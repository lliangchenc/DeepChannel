ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today criticized Amnesty International for interfering in
Afghanistan's internal affairs, said a report coming from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Amir Khan Muttaqi, minister of Information
and Culture of the Taliban interim government in Kabul, as saying,
"When the world says the Taliban shouldn't chop off hands of
thieves, sentence murderers to death, and stone adulterers, it is
interference in our internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi's comments followed a statement issued in London by
Amnesty International that hundreds of Afghan people who
sympathized with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were at
risk of torture, ill-treatment or worse.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Taliban guards are busy implementing a reign
of terror in Kabul," Amnesty International was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi noted that such criticism was "an aggression against
Islam" and could not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
In the new Islamic State of Afghanistan there will be no
compromise to secular laws about penalties for crimes such as
theft, murder and adultery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured the Afghan capital last Friday after three
days of fighting with troops loyal to Rabbani.
