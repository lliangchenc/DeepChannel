Amnesty International criticizes British arms trade

	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite its human rights pledges, Britain's Labor
Party government continues selling arms to countries such as
Indonesia and Algeria, and seeks to deter political asylum seekers,
Amnesty International said Tuesday.
	   The London-based organization said, too, that Prime Minister
Tony Blair's government is quick to condemn human rights abuses by
nations with which this country has negligible trade, including
Sudan, Iraq and Myanmar, while reluctant to act against important
political and trading partners.
	   In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia,
Indonesia and the United States _ criticized by Amnesty
International for having the death penalty _ as countries that
Britain treats delicately.
	   ``Commercial and strategic interests often still dominate
foreign policy,'' said Amnesty International.
	   ``This has led to `constructive partnership' with countries
involved in serious human rights abuses such as China and Saudi
Arabia but clear public condemnation of abuses in countries of
limited strategic importance such as Sudan and Myanmar,'' it added.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   However, Amnesty International said the Foreign Office has made
real improvements since Labor defeated the Conservative Party
government in May 1997 national elections. Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook pledged soon afterward to put human rights ``at the heart of
foreign policy.''
	   In an audit of Cook's pledge, Amnesty International praised
Britain for, it said, seeking to set up an International Criminal
Court in Rome, publishing an annual report on human rights, banning
land mines, and taking ``limited measures'' to restrict arms sales
to countries that may use them to commit human rights abuses.
	   However, the organization complained that since Labor took
power, the Trade Department has granted 10 licenses for arms
exports to Algeria, 10 for Colombia, 59 for Saudi Arabia, 64 for
Indonesia and 146 for Turkey.
	   A Trade Department spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said licenses were granted only after consultations with
the Foreign Office and Defense Ministry.
	   A year ago the government blocked two small arms deals to
Indonesia of Land Rovers and sniper rifles worth about 1 million
pounds (dlrs 1.6 million). Britain's total weapons trade with
Indonesia is worth more than 200 million pounds (dlrs 320 million)
a year.
	   On asylum seekers _ whose numbers have soared in recent years,
including many seeking a better way of life, Amnesty International
said genuine cases were regarded with grave skepticism by
government officials.
	   ``The principal message that the government is sending to those
who flee persecution is to keep out of the United Kingdom,'' said
the report.
