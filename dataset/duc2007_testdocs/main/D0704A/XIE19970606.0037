NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti today expressed the hope that Amnesty International would
in the future "be sensitive to Kenya's national sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government would not succumb to
"recommendations which question Kenya's national sovereignty or
are couched in the peremptory and prescriptive terms which are
usually employed in master-servant relationship."
</P>
<P>
In response to a memorandum by Amnesty International on human
rights situation in Kenya, the Kenyan leader told the visiting
Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre
Sane that his government appreciated constructive criticism made
in good faith.
</P>
<P>
The concerns raised in the memorandum cover a range of issues
including constitutional reform, ordinary legislative reform and
executive administration of laws.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, who is also Minister of Planning and National
Development, highlighted his government's commitment to upholding
the doctrine of separation of powers, and termed as "fiction" of
alleged executive interference of judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the independence of Kenya's judiciary, adding
that a legal notice had been promulgated delinking the judiciary
from the executive.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the constitutional reforms, the vice-president
said that after the general elections this year, a commission
would be appointed to review the Kenya constitution.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government had appointed a task force
to review public order and security laws including the
preservation of public security act, the administration police
act and the societies act.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government also appointed another task force to
review the penal laws and procedure and both task forces are at
work, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader said that President Daniel arap Moi pledged
on June 1 that the public order act would be replaced by a
peaceful assemblies act which would liberalize the exercise of
the freedom of assembly.
