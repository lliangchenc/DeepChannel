<HEADLINE> Tanzania Criticizes Amnesty International Report </HEADLINE>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
today characterized the 1996 Amnesty International Report as
biased and aimed at sowing seeds of hatred among the Tanzanian
population.
</P>
<P>
This stand was included in a press release issued by the
Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived
from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled
members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their
personal and political ends.
</P>
<P>
The press release accused the Amnesty International of
portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to
refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has
always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the
accommodation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that there were acts of human rights
violations in Zanzibar, the release deplored the organization's
report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition
party in Zanzibar without carrying any considerations or views of
the government and the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the press release of the Tanzanian Foreign
Ministry said the Amnesty International report seriously lacks
probity and in-depth scientific research, an absolute essential
for the credibility of any presentation on social work.
