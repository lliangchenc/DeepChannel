Amnesty International says Russian human rights violations persist

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Serious human rights violations persist in Russia
despite President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of 1998 as Russia's
Year of Human Rights, Amnesty International said Monday.
	   Derek G. Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights
group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the
death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no
alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
	   ``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep
gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the
practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting
with Russian media.
	   Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it
joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel
Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with
the death penalty.
	   Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty
because it did not want the expense of providing for life
imprisonment for about 1,000 people. ``In other words, it is
cheaper to kill,'' he said.
	   Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious
objection to military service.
	   ``While the Russian Federation's Constitution guarantees this
right, no legislation has been enacted to create an alternative
civilian service of non-punitive length,'' Evans said.
	   He also said that civilian prisoners in pre-trial detention were
kept in conditions ``so severe as to constitute torture.''
	   Evans said Amnesty International has provided the government
with a preliminary analysis of the human rights situation in Russia
and some 51 proposals for meeting international standards.
