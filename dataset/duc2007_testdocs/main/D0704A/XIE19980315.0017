<HEADLINE> Rwandan Government Angered by Rights Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued
campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government said that the London-based
international human rights watchdog is siding with "genocidal"
forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the
Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty
International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up
to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel
Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International released a press statement on Friday in
which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of
civilians for the January-February period.
</P>
<P>
Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan
Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been
characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw
doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and
therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the
criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed,
accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu
hardliners.
</P>
<P>
For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty
International is making up new reports shortly before the visit
by the U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month.
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies
championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists,"
Ndahiro alleged.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable that at a time some people are
trying to associate with Rwandans in the process of recovery from
the aftermath of the genocide, Amnesty International is busy
mud-slinging the Rwandan government," he noted.
