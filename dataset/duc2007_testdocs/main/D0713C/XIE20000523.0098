<HEADLINE> Pak Vows to Maintain Nuclear Deterrence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Tuesday that it
will maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any
aggression against it.
</P>
<P>
"We will act according to our best national security and
national interest," Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Iftikhar
Murshid said at a press conference here while answering a question
about reported possible further nuclear tests by India.
</P>
<P>
"Our nuclear policy is to maintain credible nuclear deterrence,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the
Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (
NPT) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in
May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We did not initiate the induction of weapons capability into
the region. Nor was Pakistan the first to conduct nuclear
explosive tests," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It accused India's nuclear tests of destabilizing the security
environment in South Asia, saying Pakistan's tests "restored the
strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the distinction between the nuclear ambitions of
India and the compulsions of Pakistan must be acknowledged and
preserved," it said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth NPT review conference, which Pakistan "decided not to
attend because of the changed nuclear realities in South Asia,"
ended in New York on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan expressed its appreciation of the conference's call
for the observance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
describing it as "a positive contribution to the strengthening of
the no-test norm."
</P>
<P>
"Having voted for the CTBT in 1996 and declared a unilateral
moratorium on further tests in 1998, Pakistan will maintain its
policy of responsibility and restraint," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Neither Pakistan nor India has so far signed the CTBT, which
will not gain effect until all the 44 countries concerned sign and
ratify it.
