MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia does not see India and
Pakistan as nuclear club members though they conducted a series of
nuclear tests, Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Wednesday.

The Interfax news agency quoted the Ministry's spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin as saying that "Despite the series of nuclear tests
conducted by India and pakistan, Russia views them as states that
do not possess nuclear weapons."

<P>
The spokesman said, "It is precisely in this capacity that we
urge these countries to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty."

In accordance with the treaty, a country is considered a
nuclear state if it had produced and tested a nuclear weapon or
another nuclear device by January 1, 1967, Nesterushkin said.

Meanwhile, in experts' opinion, neither Pakistan nor India has
done everything necessary to convert nuclear devices to warheads
and place them on delivery vehicles.

On the meeting of foreign ministers of the five nuclear powers
(Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and China) in Geneva
on Thursday, the spokesman said, "the basic goal of the meeting is
to coordinate positions and find approaches that would conduce
Delhi and Islamabad to stop further development of their nuclear
programs and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
