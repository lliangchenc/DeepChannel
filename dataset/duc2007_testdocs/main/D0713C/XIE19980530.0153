<HEADLINE> World Continues Deploring India, Pakistan Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Politicians from Europe and South
America continue to criticize India and Pakistan for conducting
nuclear tests, urging the two South Asian countries to abandon
plans for future tests.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Friday, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Italy deplores the 10 nuclear tests India and
Pakistan have conducted, asking the two neighbors not to test any
more nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
Summoning Pakistani Ambassador Arif Ayub on Friday, the Italian
Foreign Ministry voiced concerns over the Pakistani tests, adding
that India and Pakistan should start talks now and solve conflicts
with the help of the international communities.
</P>
<P>
India set off five underground nuclear devices two weeks ago,
igniting global anger. Pakistan, in response, also exploded five
nuclear devices on Thursday, claiming the tests were done for the
sake of national security.
</P>
<P>
The recent nuclear tests in the two countries have caused
worldwide concern over the possibility of a new arms race, which
could result in dangerous consequences on the South Asian
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear tests have a direct relationship with the
development of nuclear weapons," the Peruvian foreign ministry
said in a press release. "And in consequence, they are a real
danger to the stability of the region and to international
security."
</P>
<P>
The press release said it is urgent to stop nuclear testing and
create nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear
tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Argentine President
Carlos Menem, who is visiting Finland, held a joint press
conference Friday. They expressed firm opposition to the Indian
and Pakistani nuclear tests, which have resulted in international
sanctions against both New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is also
visiting Helsinki, said Moscow does not support sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Believing that sanctions achieve nothing, Moscow did admit that
the nuclear tests have made situations in South Asia explosive.
