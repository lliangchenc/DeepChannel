India, Pakistan criticized for nuclear testing

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ India and Pakistan joined the ranks
Monday of traditional targets Iraq and North Korea for flaunting
nuclear weapons conventions, as the U.N. atomic agency opened its
annual conference.
	   This spring, India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear
weapons tests that drew international condemnation.
	   ``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they
pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation
regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata
Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told
delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
	   India claimed to have detonated five nuclear devices in May, and
Pakistan said it had detonated six devices in response. The tests
triggered fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in
their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
	   Several governments, including the United States, Japan and the
European Union, urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons
testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   As in previous years, Iraq and North Korea also drew criticism
for their nuclear policies at the start of the U.N. nuclear
watchdog agency's weeklong meeting.
	   Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, said his
agency's inspection and verification operations have given it
insight into Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programs, but ``a
degree of uncertainty remains as to the completeness of this
picture.''
	   In August, Iraq limited IAEA access to declared nuclear sites,
preventing the agency from inspecting new sites or investigating
the lingering questions about the country's program, ElBaradei
said.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a press conference
``Iraq is still in substantial violation of numerous (U.N.)
Security Council resolutions.
	   ``The United States, for one, is keeping all options on the
table to ensure that Iraq complies,'' with the resolutions,
Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
added.
	   North Korea also was criticized by ElBaradei for failing to
cooperate with the IAEA. In particular, North Korea has not
preserved material the IAEA needs to verify the accuracy of
information the country has provided on its nuclear program.
