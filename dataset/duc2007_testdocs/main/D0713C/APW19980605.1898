	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in
South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution
urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and
denying nuclear status to the two rivals.
	   India accused the council of overstepping its authority and
questioned why the members were tolerating ``the continued
retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states,'' who
are all permanent members of the council.
	   In a letter to council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N.
ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved
``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which
the council has any role.''
	   Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to
ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for
elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council
members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
	   The draft resolution urges both countries to halt the
development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and
calls on them to sign nuclear arms control treaties.
	   It also asks India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and find
``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of those
tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   Japan pushed for quick council action on the resolution as a
followup to Thursday's meeting in Geneva of foreign ministers of
the five longtime nuclear states _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China.
	   Following the Geneva meeting, the five _ also permanent members
of the council _ condemned Indian and Pakistani tests and pledged
to cooperate closely ``to prevent a ``nuclear and missile arms race
in the subcontinent.''
	   Council diplomats continued closed-door consultations late
Friday trying to work out language acceptable to all 15 members _
especially the 10 non-permanent members who were not represented at
the Geneva meeting.
	   It was unclear whether the resolution, co-sponsored by Sweden
and Costa Rica, would be put to a vote Friday night or possibly
Saturday.
	   The draft resolution repeated the position of the five that
although India and Pakistan have exploded nuclear devices, they
would not be accorded status as nuclear states.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
countries were the only ones allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals.
India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty, pointing to
that exemption as unfair.
	   The Japanese resolution also welcomed an offer by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to
resume a high-level dialogue which broke down last year because of
differences over Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them Kashmir which is divided between them.
	   The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the
export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''
