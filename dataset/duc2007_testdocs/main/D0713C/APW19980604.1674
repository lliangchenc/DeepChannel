	   GENEVA (AP) _ The five longstanding nuclear states refused
Thursday to admit India or Pakistan into the nuclear club and
called on them to refrain from further nuclear tests and resolve
their differences with direct talks.
	   Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, Britain and
France, at an emergency meeting to deal with the South Asian arms
race, also promised to assist in cooling tension between India and
Pakistan and called upon them to ``avoid threatening military
movements, cross-border violations or other provocative acts.''
	   ``We are prepared to help India and pakistan maintain peace if
they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   ``It is a strong message from the permanent members of the
Security Council and they'd better stop, look, and listen,'' she
said.
	   ``The ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep
concern about the danger to peace and stability in the region, and
pledged to cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear
and missile arms race in the subcontinent,'' the powers stated in a
joint communique.
	   In rejecting the South Asian nations' bid to join the ranks of
nuclear powers, the five nations said after a two-hour meeting:
	   ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons
states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.''
	   India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to
export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to
weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them,
the communique said.
	   The leaders underscored the urgency of India and Pakistan
rejoining the global arms-control movement they sent staggering
last month when India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons
tests.
	   Specifically, they urged both nations to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty unconditionally _ meaning without any ``rewards''
such as permanent status on the U.N. Security Council or any
changes in the obligations the treaty imposes on nuclear powers.
	   Conspicuously missing from the communique was any mention of
either sanctions or incentives designed to persuade India and
Pakistan to step back from their nuclear standoff.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the communique from
the major nuclear powers would not instantly change the behavior of
India or Pakistan. He quoted a Chinese proverb: ``It is up to the
one who tied the knot to untie it.''
	   Tang opened the meeting by saying the nations are united in
calling on India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear
testing and pull back from an incipient arms race.
	   ``Tension in the region is mounting,'' Tang said. ``The
permanent members of the (U.N.) Security Council bear important
responsibility toward world peace and stability.'' He said the
purpose of the meeting was ``to channel our joint efforts to arrest
the nuclear arms race in South Asia.''
	   Albright, who called the meeting at U.N. offices here, met
separately with Tang and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
before diplomats from the five powers convened to approve the joint
communique on the India-Pakistan crisis.
	   U.S. officials said a key concern of Albright was making sure
the traditional Russian tilt toward India and Chinese support for
Pakistan do not prevent the five powers from producing a strong
joint statement.
	   Tang hinted at the Chinese inclination toward Pakistan in his
description of the events of the past month.
	   ``In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went
ahead with its nuclear tests,'' Tang said. ``After the peace and
stability in the South Asian region had been undermined, Pakistan
also carried out nuclear tests.''
	   Despite differing perspectives, the five nations adopted a
united stance.
