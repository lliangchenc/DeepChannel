<HEADLINE> Pakistan Will Not Give Up Nuclear Option: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif made it clear on Saturday that his country will not give up
its nuclear option despite the mounting pressure from some big
powers in this regard in the wake of India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeking any bargains," Sharif said in a written
statement issued at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
It is the first press conference given by the prime minister
since India conducted a series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"Overt Indian nuclear weaponization has seriously upset the
strategic balance in the region and emboldened India to make a
naked assertion of her hostile intentions towards Pakistan," the
prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"Can the Pakistani nation afford to barter its independence,
security and sovereignty? What is the price for liberty and
freedom, dignity and honor?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"The talk of sanctions is not only familiar to us but it also
does not rattle us. We have learnt to live with these punitive
measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our legitimate need for security is still being ignored," he
said, regretting that discriminatory policies were pursued by the
Western world on the nuclear issue towards Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Indian defiance (in nuclear tests) on the other hand has even
now attracted some sanctions but more understanding. Some have
even offered endorsement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of condemnation or sanctions have changed the
immediacy or magnitude of the threat to us. Practically sanctions
mean little and change nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Indian actions have rendered the
non-proliferation regime and instruments such as Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
irrelevant," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What did we earn in exchange of the restraint? Discriminatory
and punitive measures were imposed on us. In a manifestly unjust
and unfair approach Pakistan was penalized for every Indian
escalatory step on the nuclear and ballistic ladder," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian record of aggression and irresponsible behavior is
a stark reality for Pakistan. Our compulsions are not hidden. The
balance of power in the region has been violently tilted," Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances our undivided focus must be on the
preservation of our national security interests," he said.
