<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Pakistan to Sign CTBT Before India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan Tuesday urged Pakistan
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before India,
saying it would boost the image of Pakistan in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"We urged Pakistan to ensure progress in the nuclear field and
ink the CTBT before India," a senior Japanese official said after
talks held here between officials from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Tokyo will appreciate Pakistan if it takes the initiative to
show adherence to the non-proliferation treaty," Director in the
Japanese Foreign Ministry Kazauya Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Japanese delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister
Minoru Tamba, stressed the need for legislation to tighten control
over the export of nuclear technology to third country.
</P>
<P>
"We conveyed our concern over the cooperation between Pakistan
and North Korea in the nuclear field and told the Pakistani side
that it would affect ties between Pakistan and Japan," Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, who led
the Pakistani side at the talks, rejected reports that Islamabad
is receiving any assistance from third country in the nuclear
field.
</P>
<P>
"We also asked Pakistan to refrain from further test of missile
and stop the production of fissile materials," Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials, he said, told the Japanese side that
Pakistan is participating in the talks on Fissile Material Cut-off
Treaty (FMCT) in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed that Kashmir is the root cause of tension in South
Asia and hoped the tension would reduce through bilateral talks
between Pakistan and India, said Ogawa.
</P>
<P>
Japan is ready to facilitate Pakistan and India to hold talks
in Tokyo if the two countries agree, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the
CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan
after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Japan, the largest donor to Pakistan, slapped economic
sanctions after the country's nuclear tests last May. Japan had
extended 500 million U.S. dollars to Pakistan annually.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been for several months under tremendous pressure
by the Western countries to ink the CTBT before the sanctions are
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the Japanese deputy foreign minister's
visit is to convince Pakistan to sign the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of nuclear tests last May, the Japanese government
stopped granting aids and loans to Pakistan and decided not to
support Pakistan in getting loans from international financial
institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
During Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's visit to Japan
late last year, the Japanese government removed its opposition to
Pakistan's getting loans from international institutions, but
refused to lift sanctions before Pakistan signs the CTBT.
