COMMENTARY: THE PHONY RESEARCH COUNCIL

   ``It's Gay Awareness Week!'' taunted one of the two men charged
with murdering Matthew Shepard just before they slammed a pistol
butt into the University of Wyoming student's head 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Police testimony at a preliminary hearing two weeks ago also
indicates that Matthew had not made a pass at his assailants, which
didn't stop them from referring to him repeatedly as ``queer'' and
``faggot.'' By the time the beating was over, Matthew's head was
entirely covered with blood except, as a sheriff's deputy
explained, ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a slaughter driven by pathological hatred or just by
robbery? (The wallet he was carrying contained $20.) The trial will
tell, we can hope. What remains as certain now as on Oct. 12, the
day Matthew died, is that this murder happened against the backdrop
of a campaign in which the far right, abetted by political leaders
like Trent Lott, was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful.
Since FBI figures show that hate crimes due to ``sexual-orientation
bias'' are rising even as the national crime rate goes down, the
most pressing question now is: Has that ugly backdrop changed?
</P>
<P>
   Not enough. In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same
groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a
furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads
demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.
Given that these are the same groups that claim the ``pro-gay''
rhetoric of an Ellen DeGeneres or Joycelyn Elders foments
homosexuality, it isn't easy for them to argue now that their own
words have no consequences. So they instead attack those who call
them on their game, hoping we might be intimidated and shut up. As
one of their apologists, Hadley Arkes, wrote in a Wall Street
Journal opinion piece, my columns on this subject are ``vibrant
with a hatred of the Family Research Council and evangelical
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice try at changing the subject, but taking a stand
against the anti-gay crusade of the political organizations of the
religious right is not a stand against Christians, evangelical or
otherwise. Most people who abhor homophobia are themselves
Christian _ and so, for that matter, are most gay Americans. As for
the Family Research Council, it is not even a quasi-religious
organization but a moneyed secular outfit whose leader, Gary Bauer,
wants to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of
gay people as subhuman. One new tack _ according to a council draft
document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much
greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks.'' And
so the plan is to inform us that more gay men die of AIDS than of
bias-related murders _ a nonsensical pairing intended to brand gay
men as diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Since gay women can't be stigmatized en masse with AIDS, the
council had to use real ingenuity to prove that they, too, are
vermin at ``much greater risk from one another'' than from
gay-bashers. The solution turned up in a ``Culture Facts''
newsletter it published only nine days after Matthew Shepard's
death and is still posted on its Web site. Titled `` `Gay' Violence
Escalates,'' it asserts that ``The University of Houston-Downtown
in a recent study found that 47.5 percent of lesbian relationships
involve some form of domestic abuse,'' compared with 0.22 percent
for married women.
</P>
<P>
   I reached the unnamed source of this ``fact'' in Houston _ Lisa
Waldner, an assistant professor of sociology. Previously unaware of
what she called the council's ``misleading'' use of her work, she
told me that this so-called ``recent study'' was a paper she
co-wrote as a student in 1992 about the lifetime experiences of a
non-random sample of gay people she knew and their circle. She said
it was wrong to ``say this is the average for all lesbians'' and
that the council's comparison of her study with another on married
women was meaningless since they used completely different
methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   But if not even Shepard's death could derail the Family Research
Council's ``loving'' crusade against homosexuality, the unmasking
of its fallaciously ``scientific'' slurs won't stop it now.
</P>
<P>
   What, you have to wonder, will?
