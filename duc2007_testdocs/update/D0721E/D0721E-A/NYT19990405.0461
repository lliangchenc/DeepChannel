   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ In a case that galvanized national outrage over
anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on
Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was
sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was
sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the
beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months
ago. The case propelled the issue of violence against gays onto
magazine covers and into family dinner conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete
out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two
days before opening arguments were to begin in the case. In a sole
reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the
murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20
robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse
here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized
for murdering their 22-year-old son. In what may be a preview of
his testimony this August at the trial of a second man accused in
the case, Henderson described his former workmate, Aaron McKinney,
as the mastermind of the Oct. 6 kidnapping of Shepard from a bar
here.
</P>
<P>
   After listening impassively to this testimony, the judge turned
to Henderson and said, ``This court does not believe you feel any
true remorse in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that he faced an ``academic choice,'' Donnell chose
the harsher sentencing alternative, two life sentences to be served
consecutively, rather than concurrently. In his final comments
before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in
jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.
Henderson, you are a perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming legal experts said on Monday there was virtually no
chance that Henderson would ever be eligible for parole. In recent
weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of
gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the
Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with
their wider opposition to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Compressing an enormous amount of drama into a one-hour hearing,
the court proceedings included the Shepards telling Henderson of
their deep pain, the defendant giving his first public account of
the crime, and his grandmother telling a packed courtoom of a
loving young man who grew up in a household free of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed soberly in black pants, a gray shirt, and a black and
white paisely tie, Henderson had let his hair grow out, shunning
the skinhead look he favored at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 p.m., and me and Aaron decided to go out to a bar,''
Henderson testified, responding to question's by his lawyer, Wyatt
Skaggs. After drinking ``a few pitchers of beer'' at the first bar,
he said they went to a second bar, the Fireside. There, while
drinking another pitcher, he said McKinney noticed the college
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron had mentioned to me that he wanted to take him out and
rob him,'' Henderson testified in a clear if subdued voice. ``I
disagreed with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Painting his former roofing workmate as the author of the crime,
he said that McKinney told tim to drive the pickup truck borrowed
from McKinney's father, where to drive and where to park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard
to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while
he drove his friend beat Shepard. After parking in an isolated
field near a subdivision where Henderson once lived, McKinney
``pulled Matthew out of the truck and continued to hit him,'' with
the pistol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron told me to go get a rope out of the truck,'' Henderson
continued as the Shepards stared grimly ahead. ``Aaron told me to
tie his hands'' to a fence pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew looked really bad, I told him to stop,'' Henderson
continued. ``Mr. McKinney hit me above the mouth. I returned to the
pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving away, leaving the beating victim tied to a fence
in temperatures that dropped below freezing, Henderson said that he
and his friend got into another fight. When caught by a Laramie
police man, he said that he lied about what he had been doing
earlier that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, instead of calling for medical help for Shepard,
Henderson said that he and his girl friend, Chasity Pasley, and
McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen LeAnn Price, drove 50 miles east to
a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing ``and put it in a
dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pasley pled guilty in December to being an accessory after
the fact to first-degree murder and faces sentencing. Ms. Price was
freed on bond in January and faces a trial on the same charges in
May.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Henderson spoke, it was the turn of Lucy Thompson, his
maternal grandmother who has raised him since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards
have gone through,'' Mrs. Thompson, said turning to Matthew's
parents who sat in the front row of the courtroom. A devout Mormon,
she said, ``We have prayed for you many, many times. You have
showed us such mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thompson, who raised Henderson until he dropped out of
Laramie High School near the end of his senior year, described him
as ``a survivor'' whose ``mother was young and not ready to be a
mother.'' Three months ago, at age 40, Cindy Thompson Dixon,
Russell's mother, froze to death on a rural road outside of Laramie
after a night of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a ``loving and kind'' side to her grandson, she
recalled him playing on the floor with his young cousins. As his
aunts and other relatives hugged each other for comfort on a
front-row bench, she added, ``Even as a teenager, Russell was never
embarrassed to give me a hug or to kiss me on the forehead in front
of his peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to newspaper accounts of his grandson's expressionless
demeanor in court, she said, ``I have looked into his eyes, and I
know'' that he is in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``the case has developed into a hate crime,'' she
said that she never preached hatred in her household and that
``Russell has never been a hateful individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, she intimated, was a loyal follower, adding,
``Sometimes friends would take advantage of his loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing, she turned to the judge and begged him not ``to take
Russell out of our lives forever.'' Turning to Matthew's parents
again, she looked them in the eyes and said, ``I want to thank all
the Shepards. I love you even though I have never known you.''
</P>
<P>
   The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal, when it
was the turn of Henderson, who hoped to earn a slim chance of one
day winning parole.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the same podium, he turned his back to the judge and
addressed Matthew's family, saying, ``Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, there
is not a day that doesn't go by that I don't see what happened that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I did,'' he continued, turning back to Donnell.
``I'm very sorry for what I did. I am ready to pay for what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, who had traveled
from their home in Saudi Arabia for the chance to address the court
in their native Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard spoke first, pausing at times to regain her
composure as she recalled her son's blossoming interest in theater,
politics and international cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't my son, my first born anymore,'' she said, recalling
hugs and late night talks. ``He was my friend, my confidante, my
constant reminder of how good life can be.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembered that the last time she saw him he was covered
with bandages and wired with tubes in an intensive care unit of a
Fort Collins, Colo., hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his eyes was partially open,'' she recalled. ``I could
see the clear blue of his eye. But the twinkle of his life wasn't
there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the warm and trusting son she had known, she said
that touching his arm in the hospital provoked an involuntary
reaction, ``He began to shake and quiver.'' Referring to her son's
savage beating _ he was kicked in the groin and beaten 18 times
around the head _ she said in disbelief that ``such an act of
cruelty was unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress on the Shepard family was so great, she continued,
that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I don't think you are worthy of addressing,'' Mrs.
Shepard said, turning to the man who had just pled guilty to
murdering her son. Speaking slowly, but firmly, she vowed, ``We
won't allow you to kill our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, looking drawn, rose to speak, saying he had thrown away
remarks he had written on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was born blind,'' he said in an impromptu speech. ``Not
physically blind, but blind to people's differences _ short or
tall; black, brown or white; religion or ethnic backgrounds. His
friends included gays and so-called straights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet strangers and make small talk, they ask, `do you
have children?''' he continued. ``Now, I take a deep breath and say
`I have one son,' not two.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled bathing his young son, teaching him to sing ``Row,
Row, Row Your Boat,'' ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and other
nursery rhymes. With anger in his voice, he turned to the defendant
and said, ``You, Mr. Henderson, helped to sink that boat, to shoot
Frere Jacques, and to shoot down that star.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his remarks to a 175-pound man who had helped to kill
his 105-pound son, Matthew's father said, ``It takes a brave man to
tie up another man, who did not know how to clench a fist until he
was 13 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Shepards, Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney,
kept his remarks brief. Turning to the defendant, he said, ``Mr.
Henderson you have created hell on earth _ for a family, for our
community, for the state.''
