<HEADLINE> Coroner: Shepard Hit 20 Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Matthew Shepard was struck at least 20  
times, the blows raining down so hard that they fractured his skull 
a half-dozen times, a coroner testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries  
he sustained to his head and face,'' said Patrick Allen, coroner 
for Colorado's Larimer County, where Shepard died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors winced as they viewed graphic photos of the  
homosexual college student's injuries, including his bloodied face 
and ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen testified as the trial of Aaron McKinney entered a second  
day in the Albany County Courthouse. He is accused of kidnapping, 
robbery and first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have said McKinney was guilty of manslaughter,  
but have argued that his judgment was affected by drugs, alcohol 
and childhood memories of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, jurors saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where  
Shepard was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the 
pool of blood caused by blows as he fought his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed  
jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed 
his head. McKinney barely glanced up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said  
prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday. ``McKinney 
struck him as hard as he could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death  
penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend 
accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for 
a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a  
remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who  
lashed out when approached for a gay encounter. McKinney's judgment 
that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some 
sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense 
attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual  
encounters when he was younger. In one case, McKinney was forced 
into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die? No, that's ridiculous. No  
manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said. ``That's what Aaron 
McKinney is guilty of -- manslaughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked  
the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury 
was seated. Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison. The plea allowed 
Henderson to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron  
Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the 
neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, 
who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry 
this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the  
fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post. Fluty said it 
appeared Shepard had been crying. Shepard was taken to a hospital 
where he died five days later.
