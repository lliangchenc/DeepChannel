	Japan Marks Subway Nerve Gas Attack  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Station employees bowed their heads in prayer and  
victims' relatives placed flowers on subway platforms today in 
ceremonies marking the fourth anniversary of the deadly nerve gas 
attack on Tokyo's subways. At a station in central Tokyo, 30 subway 
workers and a dozen victims' relatives gathered and offered their 
prayers at 8 a.m. local time -- the time that members of the Aum 
Shinri Kyo doomsday cult released the poisonous gas on five Tokyo 
subway lines in 1995. Twelve people were killed and 5,300 were 
injured in that attack.

	America West Dodges Major Strike  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In last minute negotiations, flight attendants  
and America West Airlines have reached a contract agreement. The 
move ends a four-year fight over pay that brought the airline to 
the brink of a strike. The 2,300 flight attendants were free to 
strike after 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, but three days of talks with 
federal mediators in Washington resulted in a settlement. A 
possible strike threatened to leave up to 100,000 passengers 
stranded this weekend.

	Global Balloonists Sail Over Africa

	GENEVA (AP) -- GENEVA (AP) -- Two adventurers neared North Africa  
early today and their dream of becoming the first people to 
circumnavigate Earth nonstop in a balloon. Near exhaustion on the 
20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver 
balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland 
faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down 
soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of 
miles farther to a more dramatic landing near the pyramids in 
Egypt.

	Peace Monitors Depart Kosovo

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International monitors sent here  
five months ago to shore up a failed cease-fire were leaving Kosovo 
Saturday, while a determined NATO and defiant Serbs geared up for a 
showdown over the future of this rebellious province. Meanwhile in 
Washington, President Clinton warned that the collapse of peace 
talks in Paris had raised the stakes and ``if we and our allies 
don't have the will to act, there will be more massacres.'' NATO 
has threatened massive airstrikes against Serb-led Yugoslavia if 
President Slobodan Milosevic does not accept a peace plan providing 
for sweeping autonomy for Kosovo and NATO troops to police the 
accord.

	Train Crash Investigation Ending  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators are wrapping up  
their work at the site of a deadly Amtrak train-truck accident. 
Officials have released a list of the eleven people who were killed 
in Monday night's collision between a truck and the train. The 
question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing 
remains unanswered. National Transportation Safety Board 
investigator J.S. Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have 
witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their 
stories would be checked.

	Greece Considers Oscar Winner  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greeks who succeed abroad usually find  
their greatest admirers back in their ancestral home -- Elia Kazan 
gets a very different reception. The filmmaker son of 
Greek-American immigrants won't receive much applause when he 
receives a lifetime achievement Academy Award on Sunday -- his third 
Oscar. Kazan, 89, won Oscars for ``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 
and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954. But many Greek artists and 
others refuse to forgive Kazan's decision to identify Communist 
Party members in Hollywood during the ``blacklist'' hearings in 
Washington nearly 50 years ago.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A poor showing for the bluest of the blue-chip  
stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average lower Friday, 
ending its strongest run yet past 10,000. The Dow fell 94.07 to 
close at 9,903.55 and the Nasdaq finished at 2,421.49, down 41.47.

	Graf Beats Capriati at Lipton  
</P>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Two comebacks collided Friday, as  
Steffi Graf showed no mercy with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Jennifer 
Capriati in the second round at the Lipton Championships. ``That's 
the best she's ever played against me,'' Capriati said. The 
29-year-old Graf, slowed by injuries for much of the past two 
years, is seeking her first tournament title since November. Based 
on Friday's performance, she's a threat to upstage such youngsters 
as Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters.

	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Rookie Mike Watt scored the  
go-ahead goal as the New York Islanders snapped an eight-game 
winless skid with a 3-1 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Friday 
night. Mark Lawrence and Bryan Smolinski, who sealed the win 
scoring with 2:03 left, also scored for the Islanders in a battle 
of last-place teams.
