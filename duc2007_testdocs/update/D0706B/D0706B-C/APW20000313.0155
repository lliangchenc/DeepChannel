<HEADLINE> U.S.: Workers Rights Lag in Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forced labor, including child labor, are
widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights,
the U.S. Labor Department said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, required by Congress, updates a 1998 review of labor
conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which reached similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on findings of the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, the report
says forced labor is used to construct roads, dikes, canals and
projects to support tourism, military operations and commercial
ventures of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''The latest report on labor practices in Burma reinforces our
position that the international community must continue to push for
a democratic transition in that country,'' Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman said in a statement accompanying the report.
