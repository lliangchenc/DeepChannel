<HEADLINE> Australia Faces Embarrassment Over Uranium Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international
embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N.
committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it
endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
</P>
<P>
In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau
of the U.N. World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under
threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week
make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites
to be placed on its endangered list.
</P>
<P>
"The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed
to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both
ascertained and potential danger," the bureau said in a report
after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by
conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern
Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.
</P>
<P>
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and
mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed."
</P>
<P>
The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups
as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted
the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go
ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said
Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered
by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week.
</P>
<P>
He said he was astonished the report could call for the
scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu,
but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been
operating for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone also accused the
report's authors of predetermining their findings.
