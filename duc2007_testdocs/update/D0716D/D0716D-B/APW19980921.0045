	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A firebomb attack caused more than
100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60,000) damage Monday to a
Darwin office of the company building the controversial Jabiluka
uranium mine.
	   Four gasoline-filled beer bottles were thrown at the Energy
Resources of Australia office between 1:45 and 2 a.m., a police
spokeswoman said.
	   One went through a window while the remaining three were found
outside the office, which houses ERA's environment monitoring
division.
	   The fire caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
60,000) damage to the office's front room and computer equipment,
ERA's principal environmental engineer, Mark Daniell said.
	   Police have not yet said if they suspect a link between the
attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's
planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
The mine is opposed by the area's traditional owners and
environmentalists.
	   Anti-uranium protesters distanced themselves from the Darwin
attack.
	   ``We are a peaceful protest. This was not endorsed in any way by
the protesters. We strongly disapprove of these types of tactics,''
said Sarojani Krishnapillai, a spokeswoman for the protesters.
	   In another incident Monday, a man chained himself to the office
of a rural National Party member of Parliament and threatened to
blow himself up if the government did not change its policy on
uranium mining at Jabiluka.
	   The siege ended safely more than four hours later when police
overpowered the 50-year-old man.
	   The Jabiluka mine, which is expected to dig up almost 20 million
metric tons of uranium ore in 28 years, is supported by the current
conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.
	   But it is opposed by Labor, which says it will stop the project
it it wins government and there are no legally enforceable
contracts in place.
