	   JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ Archaeological sites that show humans
lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a
uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a
high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday.
	   The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments
and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in
the region of the mine had not been properly assessed.
	   In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether
the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu,
the council said it was particularly concerned about the
Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers)
from the mine entrance.
	   ``Malakunanja 2 is acknowledged as currently offering the oldest
dated evidence of human occupation in Australia, dating some
50,000-60,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating of
buried sands,'' the submission said.
	   The council was ``not convinced that the archaeological evidence
of Malakunanja 2 will retain its integrity given the pressures of
the proposed mine.''
	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has begun construction of the
Jabiluka mine, which lies on a lease within the boundaries of
Kakadu but technically not part of the park. Environmental groups
and local Aborigines oppose the mine.
	   ``It is not certain what impacts noise, vibration, dust and
changes to the water table might have on the natural processes of
deterioration (of the site) and whether any acceleration of
deterioration will occur,'' the council said.
	   It called on the delegation to declare Kakadu a world heritage
area that is ``in danger'' unless Jabiluka is stopped.
	   The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th
``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United
Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural
values. The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto,
Japan, in December.
	   ERA and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the
park.
	   If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old
city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn
cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of
Mali.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
