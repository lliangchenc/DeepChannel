	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian  
uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge 
tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman 
Environmental Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize  
efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make  
a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards. 
``You don't need a special education, special training or a special 
background to help save the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed  
mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the 
world's richest untapped uranium bodies. The government-approved 
mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing  
following a protest against the mine. Later, Katona urged a United 
Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an 
attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the 
land for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team  
in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that 
allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of  
individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few 
private companies,'' Nguiffo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 million to 30 million people live in or near the central  
African rain forest, which is second in size only to the Amazon 
forest in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recipients of the 10th annual Goldman awards were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of the Karen ethnic minority in Burma,  
now known as Myanmar. He fled his home during military rule 10 
years ago. He has interviewed more than 1,000 victims of human 
rights abuses and documented environmental abuses, including 
increased logging and the hunting of elephants and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bernard Martin, a former fisherman from Newfoundland who has  
called for reduced fishing quotas after witnessing the collapse of 
Canada's east coast fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jorge Varela, a conservationist who has worked to contain the  
expansion of shrimp farming along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras. 
Environmentalists say shrimp farming has destroyed critical coastal 
wetlands, displaced traditional fishing communities and 
contaminated fresh water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Michal Kravcik, a Slovakian hydrologist who galvanized support  
to stop a proposed dam that would have destroyed the environment 
and forced the evacuation of four 700-year-old villages.
