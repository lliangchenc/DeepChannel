<HEADLINE> Western Turkey Refinery Blaze Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL (Turkey), August 21 (Xinhua) -- Blaze in a refinery in
western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts
made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the
boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying
that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province
caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with
the help of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands,
Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia have been participating in the fight
against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30
storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The fire fighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to
control the flames in the Izmit Refinery, about 110 kilometers
southeast of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Alakoc added that the fire has burnt 250,000 tons of the crude
oil in the Turkey's largest oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
Turkish experts are expected to make research for the pollution
caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the
Izmit Refinery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an
urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey. Many taxi
drivers in Istanbul have been lining up for filling LPG as the
Izmit Refinery stopped supplying petrol to the city.
