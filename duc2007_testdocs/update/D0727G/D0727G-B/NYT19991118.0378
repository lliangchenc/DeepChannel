 &HT;    Gingrich's wife feeling pain of public divorce
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford and Mark Sherman

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last May, Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing
another woman and wanted a divorce. He didn't mention the affair
had been going on for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out with the rest of the country,'' said Marianne
Gingrich, who spoke publicly about her divorce this week. The
remarks are her most extensive since the days immediately after her
husband's July divorce petition was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's
ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House, surprised his wife.
And it jolted many of Gingrich's colleagues still in Congress,
fueling an already bubbling debate over the impact of Gingrich's
divorce on his unofficial role in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich's attorneys said his ``intimate
relationship'' with congressional aide Callista Bisek started in
November 1993, about a year before the Republican takeover of the
U.S. House. The revelation was made before an impromptu gathering
of reporters outside Washington _ and it stung, Marianne Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a marriage. This is not about politics and
another press conference. This is about my life,'' she told The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich said she heard about the news conference from
a friend, who called her from a cell phone shortly afterwards. She
said her thoughts immediately went back to late 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's attorneys have said he and Marianne were
separated when the relationship with Bisek began.
</P>
<P>
   But Marianne Gingrich says she and her husband were living
together in a Marietta, Ga., condo. And while he was in Washington,
she was traveling between Ohio, where her mother was recovering
from a diabetes-related illness, and Florida, where her brother was
fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, my family was in medical crisis,'' she said. Her
brother later died of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of her
18-year marriage and her husband's affair. ``I don't have any way
to express it without getting into some really deep emotions that I
don't want to share right now,'' she said. ``However, it's been
good for me to be involved in a number of community activities,
including the Red Cross and Mission Specialties.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, 48, is chairwoman of the Red Cross' Northwest
Metro Service Center. She's also helping Mission Specialties, an
international service organization, raise money to buy shoes for
Russian orphans.
</P>
<P>
   In a People magazine article that comes out today, Marianne
Gingrich said she has lost 35 pounds, the result of stress and
diet. She plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when
attorneys for Bisek, 33, will try to persuade a judge to toss out
Marianne Gingrich's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn
over documents related to her relationship to Newt Gingrich, 56.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the divorce is beginning to concern some of
Gingrich's GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress are fretting over whether Gingrich
should be invited to a January celebration of the fifth anniversary
of the Republican takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said Wednesday that he expects
Gingrich to be invited to the January event. But U.S. Rep. J.C.
Watts (R-Okla.) did not endorse an invitation when he and Coverdell
discussed the event with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) argued that Gingrich's new job
as a political commentator for Fox News makes it inappropriate to
include him in political gatherings. ``Time marches on. He's gone
on to other pursuits,'' Hayworth said. But, then, he added, ``If
you're looking for a spirited defense of the speaker's private life
from me, you'll not get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans in Congress, from Georgia and elsewhere, have
jumped to Gingrich's defense. ``It's only right that we invite Newt
Gingrich to return for any celebration. His ideas and his vision
put together the Contract With America,'' Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.)
said. ``His biggest problem was that he thought out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the same day Gingrich's attorneys said his affair
with Bisek stretched back six years, Republican House members who
took office in 1995 held a reunion in Washington. Gingrich's
attendance at that gathering had been an issue, too. As it turned
out, he was in New Orleans and couldn't make it, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scheduling conflict saved us from having to fight this
out,'' said Rep. Gil Gutknecht (R-Minn.), who helped put the
reunion together.
