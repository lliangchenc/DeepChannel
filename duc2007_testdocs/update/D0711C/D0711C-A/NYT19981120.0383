MICROSOFT FINDS SILVER LINING IN TOKYO REPRIMAND

   After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade
Commission told Microsoft Corp. Friday to change permanently one of
its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch
its step in the Internet browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also
stated that Microsoft's business practices ``cannot be immediately
found to have tended to impede fair competition'' in the market for
browser software in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a
major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices
as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had
not found an anticompetitive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an
American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at
the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,'' said
Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade
Commission had informed the company two months ago that its
investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded
and that no further review was expected.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct link between the several overseas
investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in
Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued
Microsoft. Antitrust experts said that most countries still
investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see
stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S.
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of
competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was
``closely watching'' the trial in Washington, so for the present,
there was no reason to devote more resources to the European
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting itself is a kind of helpful coordination among
nations,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York
University Law School. ``And I certainly wouldn't draw the
inference from the Japanese Fair Trade Commission's statement that
Microsoft is off the hook in Japan at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese investigation of Microsoft began in October 1997,
but accelerated sharply on the morning of Jan. 13 when 20 uniformed
police officers swept into Microsoft's offices in the Shinjuku
district of Tokyo. The investigation was stepped up after Joel I.
Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, visited Japan in December. But in
response to a Senate question on the matter, the Justice Department
said that Klein had not encouraged Japan ``to take action of any
kind against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese antitrust agency did find that Microsoft had been
engaging in an unfair trade practice by bundling its Excel
spreadsheet and Word text program in sales to personal computer
makers. Microsoft began bundling the two products for sales to PC
makers three years ago, after a Japanese rival, Justsystem Corp.,
did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it began making it easier for PC makers in Japan
to load the two products separately in April, though most PC
companies still preferred the bundled offering. Microsoft says it
has no plans to challenge the Japanese agency's order, which the
fair trade commission terms a ``recommendation.''
