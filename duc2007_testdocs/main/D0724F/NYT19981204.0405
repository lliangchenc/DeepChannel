   BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have
done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United
States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of
children now considered obese, a top US health official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health
issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this
mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr. William H. Dietz,
director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to solving the tobacco problem. The next
major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said
Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that obesity and related health problems consume
about 6 percent of the national health care budget, as estimated by
one recent Harvard study, ``not to do anything about obesity and
physical inactivity is very expensive,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other
speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and
statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds
and the difficulty in shedding them.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of
10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a
result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being
consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz
has calculated but not yet published.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who
gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result
of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time
period. A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that
period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day,
according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex
formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana
provides about 80 calories.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent
obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first
revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years,
adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height
measurements, according to Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better
measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and
height charts.
</P>
<P>
   The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and
parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the
same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of
other children of the same age. ``That's a big deal,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income
children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras, director of Pediatric and
Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public
Health, presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts
children under the age of five in the government nutritional
program Woman, Infants, and Children.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels,
an indication of anemia, while the percentage of children who were
overweight was more than twice as high as expected, 10.5 percent.
Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary 1997 figures, to be released in the next couple of
months, suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight
children in WIC, but the numbers for low hemoglobin, short stature,
and being under weight appear to be holding steady,
Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview.
