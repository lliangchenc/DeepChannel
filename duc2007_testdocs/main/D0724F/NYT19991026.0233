 &HT;    No big, fat lie: Americans losing battle with obesity

   ATLANTA _ It's official: We're fat _ all over America, and
particularly in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent
_ are now overweight or obese, according to research being
published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based
agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent
of adults who are obese, CDC said. From 1991 to 1998, the
proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal
body weight doubled.
</P>
<P>
   That means, according to state public health experts, that
almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely
increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2
diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so
dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as
the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as
smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obesity is a serious health condition, and it is occurring at
an epidemic level,'' Dr. Jeffrey Koplan said. ``Overweight and
physical inactivity account for more than 300,000 premature deaths
each year, second only to tobacco-related deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Excess weight is increasing as rapidly in the population as an
infectious disease might spread, and should be treated as seriously
as an epidemic, Koplan said. He presented new research by CDC
scientists at a Los Angeles conference hosted by the American
Medical Association. The Journal of the American Medical
Association publishes a special issue today devoted to obesity and
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Georgia. Although rates of
obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the
most in Georgia, according to CDC's research. In 1991, 9.2 percent
of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing
in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr. Kenneth Powell,
an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health. ``We're
also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular
physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2
percent every year for the past 15 years. The combination of eating
too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our
overweight and obesity levels up.''
</P>
<P>
   A statewide information campaign titled ``Take Charge of Your
Health'' has been in preparation for two years and is scheduled to
debut in November with billboards, public service announcements and
community forums, according to Alice Trainer in the state's Office
of Nutrition and Physical Activity.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down
fat, take action'' _ that is, increase fruits and vegetable
servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure
called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by
the square of height in meters. BMIs of 30 and above are considered
obese. BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard
for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an
additional 29 million Americans. Under the old guidelines, men with
a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts
University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys
conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked
to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese,
compared to 43 percent in 1962. (Both percentages reflect the new
weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered
over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an
apples-to-apples comparison. )
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost one-fifth of all adults are now obese, defined as being
more than 30 percent above ideal weight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults,
college graduates and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the
side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on
the U.S. health care system.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and
prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation
has directed against tobacco in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious
diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said. ``For
both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these
conditions. (But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was
considered a social issue, not a health issue. Similarly, we need
to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a
health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on
weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in
1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with
leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the
hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100
participants lost. The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as
opposed to muscle tissue. There appeared to be no adverse effects
on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which
was partially supported by Amgen, Inc., a pharmaceutical company
that synthesizes leptin.
