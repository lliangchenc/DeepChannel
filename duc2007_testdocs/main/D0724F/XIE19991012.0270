<HEADLINE> New U.S. Studies Detail Lifetime Risks of Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Two studies published this
month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the
substantial health risks of obesity.
</P>
<P>
Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits
that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by
medical professionals and has been established by the American
Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart
disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
</P>
<P>
According to Policy Analysis Inc., a health economic research
firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and
that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The studies are based on data relating to a person's degree of
obesity to their risks of five major diseases -- coronary heart
disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and high
blood cholesterol. In these studies, obesity was measured in terms
of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight
in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
</P>
<P>
The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of
Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher
lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese (
BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of
developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2)
of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing
type 2 diabetes. Risks are even greater among those who are
severely obese.
</P>
<P>
Published in the October issue of the American Journal of
Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic
benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among
persons who are overweight or obese.
</P>
<P>
The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would
substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that
people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and
hypercholesterolemia. The likelihood of developing coronary heart
disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000
persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.
