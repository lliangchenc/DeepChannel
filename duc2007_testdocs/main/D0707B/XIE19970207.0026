<HEADLINE> NATO Chief: Turkey May Not Veto NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana today said he is hopeful that Turkey would not veto the
planned NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from his 24-hour visit to Ankara, Solana
told reporters at airport that "I think it has been very positive
to understand the position of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Turkish leaders reiterated their position
to link the expansion of the NATO with Turkey's entry into the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it might block plans for the NATO
expansion if its plea for EU accession is stalled. The European
Commission is considering the membership applications by up to 10
possible candidates, but Turkey is not among them.
</P>
<P>
Solana said "I think we will be able to calm that concern."
</P>
<P>
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey's concern,
Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by
the Western European Union, the EU's military body.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued following his meeting with Solana,
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey will not
support the enlargement of the NATO because the EU does not admit
Turkey into the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said, "Although we are for the enlargement of the NATO
in principle, we think that it is important for this issue to be
evaluated within the general framework of European new formation."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey should take its place in a European
family picture in the EU summit scheduled to be held in
Amsterdam in June.
