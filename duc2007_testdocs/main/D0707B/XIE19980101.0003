<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Change Position Towards Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today called on neighboring Turkey to change its
stance towards Greece.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, Tsohatzopoulos stressed that
aggressiveness did not help Turkey's relations with the European
Union (EU), and Turkey should give serious consideration to the
problems noted by the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if Turkey realised this in the future, it
would greatly help to improve the current climate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU decided not to include Turkey on the
list of nations waiting to join the bloc, on the grounds of
Turkey's "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece."
</P>
<P>
After that, Turkey announced the suspension of its political
dialogue with the EU and increased its pressure upon Greece.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two neighboring countries intensified
recently with the mutual expulsion of diplomats and violations of
Greek airspace by Turkish jet fighters.
