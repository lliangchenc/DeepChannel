<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Turkey to Meet European Standards in Ocalan's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Tuesday that Italy expects Ocalan's trial in Turkey will
meet standards and guarantees laid down by the Council of Europe,
of which Turkey is a member.
</P>
<P>
He said that those conventions do not envisage the death
penalty, and the Ocalan case could test Turkey's ability to meet
European standards and may help its bid to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy would continue to support that bid as long as
Turkey moves closer to Europe on human and civil rights and the
treatment of minorities, the main stumbling block to its EU
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that Italy and the European Union condemned all
forms of terrorism and urged Kurds everywhere to refrain from
violent protest against Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that
Ocalan was brought to Turkey from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's Italian lawyers confirmed that Tuesday morning that
the Greek embassy in Nairobi had turned Ocalan to Kenyan
authorities, and then with the permission of Kenya, Turkey took
Ocalan back to the country with a special military airplane.
