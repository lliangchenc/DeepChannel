<HEADLINE> US Urges EU to Accept Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said today
that the European Union (EU) should accept Turkey as its new
member in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a European country," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters. "We strongly believe that the
European Union should allow the possibility of Turkish membership
in the future."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Some EU members insisted that Turkey is an Asian nation, not
European.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a vote in the European Union, nor do we seek
one," Burns said. "But we very respectfully think of Turkey as a
European country and not send negative signals to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), signed an agreement on Customs Union with the
EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.
