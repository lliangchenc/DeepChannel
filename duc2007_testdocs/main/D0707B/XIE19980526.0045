<HEADLINE> Kinkel Does Not See EU Membership for Turkey in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he did not expect that Turkey would be admitted into
the European Union "in foreseeable future".
</P>
<P>
"The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human
rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's
economic problems and its relations with Greece," said Kinkel at a
conference on the subject of "Islam and Europe" in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Despite the EU membership dispute with Turkey, Kinkel stressed
Germany wanted to strengthen relations with the country in all
areas.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU
leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official
new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has blamed German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for blocking Turkey's entry into the EU due
to its Islamic background.
