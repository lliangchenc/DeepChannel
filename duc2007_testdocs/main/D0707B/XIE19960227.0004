<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges EU To Release Financial Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed the
European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and
urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite
Greek efforts to block it.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday turned down a
Greek proposal to adopt a common condemnation of Turkey
concerning the two countries' dispute over an Aegean islet.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last month when both Turkey and Greece
claimed sovereignty over a set of small islands, called Kardak in
Turkish and Imia in Greek, in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The United States later intervened, preventing a war between
the two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European
Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between
Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Greece, despite its attempts, was
unable to get the support of the other 14 European Union members
in getting a statement that would express solidarity with Greece
and condemn Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14
members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the
framework of customs union," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara also urged the EU to release its planned
financial assistance, a sum of 375 million ECU (483.75 million
U.S. dollars), despite Greek attempt to block it.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the European Union to take the decision for the
implementation of the financial assistance, an indispensable
factor...in the customs union, as soon as possible," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Britain and France have urged Greece not to force
the EU into a legal battle with Turkey over the financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ankara maintains that the withholding of the assistance
would be a violation of the customs union accord, which might
go as far as to the European Court of Justice.
