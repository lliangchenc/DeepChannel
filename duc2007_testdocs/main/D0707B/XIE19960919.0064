<HEADLINE> European Parliament Blocks Special Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament today
voted to block a 53 million ECU (70 million U.S. dollars) special
aid package to Turkey because of what it called a "deterioration
in the human rights situation" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted 319 for,
23 against the resolution with 20 abstentions, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament accused Turkey of "increasing
provocation in the Aegean Sea and in Cyprus, and aggressions in
the north of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European
Union (EU) and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament also called on the European Commission
not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the "Meda" program for
Mediterranean countries, except for projects concerning the
"promotion of democracy and human rights."
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned "the brutal assassination of two Greek
Cypriots by Turkish soldiers supported by para-military forces,"
during inter-ethnic confrontation last month on the divided
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
