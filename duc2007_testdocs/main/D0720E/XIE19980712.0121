<HEADLINE> Arafat: Failure in Peace Means Violence for Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed
Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua
on the eve of his visit to China. He will start his three-day
visit to China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians are seeking peace -- but with several
options all open in resisting the abhorred Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"We have the longest revolution and the longest intifada
(uprising) in the modern history. The collapse of the (signed
peace) accords ... will return the region to the circle of
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said,
"only requires the honest implementation of the accords and
adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international
legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242
and 338."
</P>
<P>
Arafat blamed Israel for the 16-month-old stalemate in the
peace process, saying the Israeli side had in reality
relinquished the peace accords ever since the Israeli incumbent
government came to power two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel has failed to keep their promises made in signed
agreements on issues like redeployment in the West Bank, Jewish
settlements, and issues of transition period, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"These measures constitute grave and flagrant violation of
international legitimate resolutions, including Resolution
242 ... They also violate the Oslo accords which very distinctly
call for refraining from any measures that touch any issues of the
final negotiating phase with the issue of Jerusalem in the
forefront," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of
Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods
and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"We are regularly losing more than 10 million (U.S.) dollars
each day by the economic blockade, that is to say, many times as
much as the donor countries are offering if measured on annual
basis," he said, adding that unemployment rate in the Palestinian
areas exceeds 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy is causing much frustration to the
Palestinians and leading to misery and grave danger, Arafat said,
noting that "the situation is approaching starvation, and I ring
the bells of danger. In as much as peace is in the interest of
all, the explosion will hit everyone."
