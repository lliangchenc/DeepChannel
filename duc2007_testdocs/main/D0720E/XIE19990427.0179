<HEADLINE> Arafat Favors Declaration of Statehood on May 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat
said here Tuesday that he favored to declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council, Arafat said the outcome and
fate of the Palestinian people's struggle have asked the
Palestinian leadership to declare an independent Palestinian
state in the territories on time.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat briefed the council members about the
current development in the Middle East peace process, the
situation in the region and his discussions about the statehood
issue with leaders of foreign countries he recently visited.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, the issue of the statehood declaration should
be decided by the council.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Arafat's address to the meeting, a report on
whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this
year was submitted to the council for consideration, a senior
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton's letter to Arafat was
also made public to the council, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The PLO Central Council started discussing here Tuesday over
the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
attended the meeting as observers. Representatives from other
Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would
announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the
teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian
self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo
Accords.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians
from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are
demonstrating in front of the Office, urging the council and
Arafat not to postpone the declaration on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo
principles, he has the right to declare an independent
Palestinian state on that date. For this purpose, he traveled
recently to many countries in the world to seek their support and
advise over this matter.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank territories now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to
declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set
themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement
within in a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter
to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the
announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help
move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement
the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring
Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after
Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to
help reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but
the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are
anxiously to see what decision the council would make on this
statehood issue.
