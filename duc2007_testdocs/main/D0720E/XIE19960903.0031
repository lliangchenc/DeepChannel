<HEADLINE> Egypt Issues Ultimatum to Israel over Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today gave Israel
three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians,
otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic
summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum was issued by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny said that Egypt demanded Israel to take immediate
actions in implementing the signed agreements with the
Palestinians. The actions included redeploying Israeli troops from
Hebron, conducting further redeployments under the Oslo accords,
opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
lifting the closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Egypt wants deeds but not words from the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny issued the stern warning only one day after Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy paid his first visit to Egypt, during
which he held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic
summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank
town of Hebron, saying, "I cannot imagine that the economic
summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not
happened yet."
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron
pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of
extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early
March. The new Israeli government promised to conduct the
pullout, but demanded certain revisions.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of implementation, it will be a very serious
situation. It is impossible to imagine that we can talk about
regional cooperation when the peace process is obstructed or
paralyzed. It would be illogical, out of the question," Moussa
added.
</P>
<P>
Levy said today Moussa's view was exactly that of Mubarak,
who was responsible for issuing the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
In a strong reaction to Egypt's threat, the Israeli government
today warned Cairo against "making things worse" by issuing such
an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a
statement blasting Egypt for issuing "an unfortunate threat that
can only raise the tension in the region." An Israeli official
pointed out that Egypt needs the Cairo summit more than Israel
does.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the
Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Although Egypt is the first Arab country that established
diplomatic ties with Israel, the two states have been slow in
normalizing their relations, which are often marred by the
disputes over the peace process and bilateral frictions.
