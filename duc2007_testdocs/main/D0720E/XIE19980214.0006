<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Slams Arafat's Warning About Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- In a counter-warning to the
Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Friday it would bring disaster on themselves if they resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued the warning here when he spoke to a visiting
delegation of Jewish community in the United States. He was
commenting on the warning given by Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat that the Palestinian people would
renew intifada (uprising) against Israel if the peace process
collapses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday at the ceremony held in Ramallah to mark the
50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his
pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999
at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final
peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would struggle to establish an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Netanyahu launched a scathing attack on the PNA
for violating the Oslo peace accords. He condemned the PNA for
failing to prevent pro-Iraqi demonstrations, refusing to revise
the Covenant and glorifying terrorists. He also warned that
Israel will scuttle the Oslo accords if Arafat declares
independence.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of war of words came at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over
Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed last
January, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the
three-phased redeployment by September last year. But Israel has
delayed the move due to a dispute over the scope of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators concluded their
talks in Washington Friday, without achieving any breakthrough in
breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides only agreed to continue to talks next week in the
region under the supervision of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward
Walker.
