<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat emphasized Sunday in Gaza
that Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, according to the
Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the
Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel
should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Israel's activities marking the 31st
unification of Jerusalem which are going on on Sunday here. Israel
captured the whole Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged the United States to announce its peace
initiative concerning Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank
in order to put more pressure on the Israeli government to live up
to its contractual obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his meeting in Cairo with Egyptian
Presdient Hosni Mubarak, they discussed the Egyptian-French
initiative for convening an international conference for countries
aiming at breaking the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting was positive and constructive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of extremist Jewish demonstrators
are gathering near the Kattanin Gate that leads to the Al-Aqsa
Mosque in East Jerusalem, as part of their 31st celebrations of
Jerusalem unification.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish demonstrators burned a model of Oslo Accords and
tried to enter into the Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials and civilians, including the
PNA's Jerusalem governor, are gathering inside the premises of the
Mosque to try to prevent the Jewish demonstrators from entering
into the holy site.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Peace Bloc also demonstrated in East Jerusalem on
Sunday to voice their support for the the peace process.
</P>
<P>
There is so far no report of conflict between Israelis
demonstrators and Palestinians.
