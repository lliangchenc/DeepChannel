NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) - The Rwandan government has
launched a big campaign to ease water shortage rocking northeast
Rwanda, the Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday.

known for their aridity and scarce water resources.

in Umutara was exacerbated by an unusual drought that hit the
disaster area because of a prolonged dry season.

Over three quarters of approximately 480,000 people in Umutara
prefecture are faced with severe drought.
