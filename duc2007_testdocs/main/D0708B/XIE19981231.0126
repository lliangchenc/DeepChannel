<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Warns of Water Shortage in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has urged residents in capital Dar es
Salaam to use water sparingly as another water shortage is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was shocked to find that the water level at
Ruvu River, the main source of water of the city, is "alarmingly
low" when he inspected the Ruvu water works Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa, Sumaye
inspected the Ruvu water works at Mlandizi in the eastern Coast
Region, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye ordered the Ministry of Water to make sure that
wells dug in the capital city last year are operational as a
preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
He also directed water technicians and engineers to find
alternative water sources, saying that "this is not a time for
water engineers to sit in their offices."
</P>
<P>
Below average rains associated to the La Nina weather
phenomenon has led to a drought in most parts of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has called on residents to use water
carefully when they wash cars and water flowers and trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a long spell of dry weather resulted in a low water
level of Ruvu River and shortage of supplies to Dar es Salaam.
