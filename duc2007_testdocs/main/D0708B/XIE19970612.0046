<HEADLINE> New Reservoir Constructed Near Iranian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today picked the ground for Mamloo reservoir dam near
Tehran, a project designed to alleviate the water shortage problem
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The dam, on the juncture of Damavand and Jajroud rivers, 40
kilometers east of Tehran, has a designed capacity of 250 million
cubic meters of water which will irrigate 5,400 hectares of
farmland. It will also operate a 8.5 megawatt hydro-electric power
plant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the site of the dam, the president said that the
main obstacle in the way of development of Tehran is water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a
population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all
measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to
various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand,
Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj.
</P>
<P>
Mamloo dam will harness more than 200 million cubic meters of
river water and turn it to drinking and irrigation water, he added.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Mamloo dam and the power plant, which will
be completed by the year 2001, will cost 180 billion rials
(about 60 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The water shortage problem is serious for Tehran this year
though the capital city is supplied with water from two main
reservoirs -- one in the west and the other in the east of the
city.
