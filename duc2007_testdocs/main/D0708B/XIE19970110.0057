<HEADLINE> Cyprus Imposes Strict Measures to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has decided to impose
strict measures to save fresh water as the island's water reserves
are currently at the lowest level since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment
Costas Petrides today called for urgent water supply cuts to deal
with the severe water shortage which followed a dry winter.
</P>
<P>
"If this situation continues, there will be no drop of water
left by 1998 in our reservoirs," the Minister told reporters,
noting strict measures are "the only solution."
</P>
<P>
Petrides classified the measures to ease water shortage in
three categories, namely the reduction of water supply, its
better saving and the increase of water reserves available.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, water supply to households will be
cut by 20 percent, which means water will be supplied only three
days a week, compared with 10 percent last year. Water for farming
purposes will be cut by up to 70 percent compared with 35 percent
the year before.
</P>
<P>
The measures also include higher fines against people who waste
water.
</P>
<P>
A study would be carried out for recycling of households water
for watering gardens. This can save up to 34 per cent of a
household's needs, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Petrides called on the public to make "painful saving" of
water and said his ministry will launch an intensive campaign to
increase public awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said water shortage will be solved "if we develop
an increased awareness on water saving."
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island relies mainly on rainfall for
is water supply.
</P>
<P>
The first desalination plant is being constructed on the island
and will be operational in April.
</P>
<P>
The government approved Wednesday a plan for setting up a
second desalination plant near the southern town of Larnaca,
which will be completed by 1998.
</P>
<P>
A further two similar plants are also envisaged for Limassol and
Paphos areas.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that water shortage would be eased
to a great extent once these plants become fully operational.
