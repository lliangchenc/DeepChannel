<HEADLINE> Water Shortage in Kenya's Capital Enters Third Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The acute water shortage in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi entered its third month Tuesday with
water-borne diseases imminent.
</P>
<P>
The residents in the city warned that an outbreak of
water-borne diseases like cholera was impending unless water
supply is restored immediately in the city with a population of 2
million.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded the Nairobi City Council to announce a water
 rationing program to enable them to know the time to draw water,
the East African Standard newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the program will save them from being exploited
by unscrupulous water vendors, who usually sold a 20 litre
container of water at 30 shillings (around 0.4 U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
City residents complained that the vendors had capitalized on
the water shortage to make quick profits from people desperate for
water.
</P>
<P>
"People can survive without electricity but they can not
survive without water as it is an essential commodity," said Mama
Njeri, a resident.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi City Council recently worked out a rationing plan but
the schedule has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current drought in the Horn of Africa, water
shortage has reigned throughout the east African country and more
than 2.2 million Kenyans are threatened by starvation.
