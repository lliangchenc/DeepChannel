XI'AN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A project will be launched this
year to solve the water shortage problem for Yan'an, an old
revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving a total investment of 185 million yuan
(about 22 million US dollars), will be built by the Ministry of
Water Conservancy and the province, and is scheduled to be
completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At present, the water supply capacity there is only 30,000 tons
daily, half the amount needed. In dry seasons the shortage of
water is particularly acute.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of water has long plagued the daily lives of the
180,000 people of Yan'an, not to mention the city's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The project will divert water from the Wangyao Reservoir, 65 km
from the city's urban area. It includes the construction of a
water pipeline, a water purifying plant, and a water supply network
in the urban district, and improvement of the Fangta Reservoir.
