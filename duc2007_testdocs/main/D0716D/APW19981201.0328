Australia defies UN by giving uranium project green light
</HEADLINE>

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government
defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a
World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at
Jabiluka within the park.
	   The U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization did
accept a plea from the Australian government that it be given six
months to respond to the panel's ruling.
	   But the panel recommended that all mining activities should
cease in the meantime. It said the mine, which could process 19.5
million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could
damage the environment.
	   The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most
vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the
Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as
an enclave within it.
	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a
comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report, which he has described
as superficial and unbalanced.
	   But he would not tell uranium miner Energy Resources of
Australia, which is still 18 months away from mining the first
uranium and is still doing preparatory work, to comply with the
UNESCO call.
	   ``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for
approval of the mine,'' Hill said.
	   ``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a
national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural
damage,'' Hill said.
	   Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to
the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over
18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka.
	   Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's
announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's
reputation.
	   Greens party Senator Bob Brown said, ``Even major uranium buyers
like France, Japan and the U.S. -- members of the World Heritage
Committee -- voted to stop this obscene mine.''
	   ``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage
Convention no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added.
	   Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of
Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu.
	   They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report
shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people
and the rest of the world.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq. km.) of flood
plains and plateau on Australia's north coast, with waterfalls and
hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or
endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
