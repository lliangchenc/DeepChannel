<HEADLINE> Booted Napster Fans Want Back On  </HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of Metallica fans booted by
online music sharing software company Napster Inc. for allegedly
swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000
MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as
persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the
popular MP3 digital format.
</P>
<P>
   If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users
within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those
blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's
attorney, who disputed their claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're (the users) absolutely lying. There's no question that
they're lying,'' said attorney Howard King. ''Each and every one of
them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica sued the company last month for copyright infringement
and racketeering, alleging that Napster's software encouraged users
to freely trade the band's songs without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were
trading the band's tunes. The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich,
hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San
Mateo two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it
also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a
counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed
Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates
that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old
founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client,
rap artist Dr. Dre, to notify Napster on Wednesday of more than
200,000 users who illegally traded his music.
