 SENATE DECIDES TO STAY OUT OF MUSIC DOWNLOADING CONTROVERSY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part
of the hottest controversy in the music business, ensuring that the
youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will
continue to reshape the industry, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with
the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of
Internet music downloads, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``I think the courts can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging
copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music
distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no
action now.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont
agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of
videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer
new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,''
Leahy said. ``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle.''
</P>
<P>
   The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington
from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios
and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines
ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of
copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution
of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their
livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm
consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Internet distributors contend that established industries are
trying to stifle a hugely  &LR; popular technology that will bring
untold convenience and flexibility to consumers. They say they want
to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have
been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with
huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco
companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as
Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a
free software that allows users to download music from each other's
computers rather than a central server _ are inherently
uncontrollable. Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's
prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by
Napster-like technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often
indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday,
lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing
Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking,
piracy and theft of artistic property.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic
American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to
own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a
song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that
radio stations were already playing versions of the work in
progress. The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,''
Ulrich said. ``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a
company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a
penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's
20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright
law. Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not
hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music
before buying it, leading to more store sales. And he said Internet
distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording
studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits
as ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he
``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager
advances. ``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs
to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet
distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent
non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music
that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat
Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues
on copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which
entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but
Feinstein was undeterred. ``You could do the same thing with a
book,'' she said. ``You could do the same thing with a movie. You
are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with
your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the
other end of a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every
technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes
to VCRs. These horrible prophecies have not come true. In every
case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella,
which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and
Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in
electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the
``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20
million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated
eventually, Kan predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City,
agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability
of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance
on physical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents
for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists
and cannot compete with free music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster
will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned
that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that
``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording
studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are
compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings.
