 JUDGE ORDERS NAPSTER TO STOP MUSIC TRADING  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Handing the recording industry a resounding
victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a
preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service
to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected all of
Napster's legal arguments and ruled that the program is primarily a
conduit for ``wholesale infringing'' of copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who
use the Internet program to trade free music with each other.
</P>
<P>
   And officials with the San Mateo startup claim the ruling could
be a death blow to its fledgling business because, it said, its
program cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs.
</P>
<P>
   Napster executives said they will appeal as early as Thursday to
keep Napster online. The company's high-powered defense attorney
David Boies said Napster will have to shut down the service if a
higher court does not grant a stay of the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised and disappointed,'' Napster's interim CEO
Hank Barry said moments after the verdict. ``We understand the
ruling and the basis for it, but we disagree with it. We do not
believe Napster users are acting illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   Patel issued her much-anticipated ruling at the end of a 21/2
hour hearing. The judge's small courtroom was packed, and more than
150 lawyers, journalists, online music company executives and
Napster fans had to watch the proceedings on closed circuit
television in an adjoining courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's ruling is historic because it sets the tone for how the
established entertainment industries deal with the increasing
problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster.
Already, other programs like Gnutella, Freenet and Scour have
extended the Napster ``peer-to-peer'' file-sharing concept to
digital pictures and first-run movies. The same idea could be used
to swap electronic books and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will pave the way for the future of online
music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording
Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the
top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The quick rise of the Napster program, originally written by a
19-year-old college student, Shawn Fanning, alarmed the $40 billion
U.S. recording industry. Napster estimates there are 20 million
users of the program, first released in August 1999. Once
considered a fad among teens and college students, Napster has now
also become popular with people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Napster user Hidehiro Beppu, 21, studying math at the University
of California at Berkeley, was also disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bogus. Napster doesn't do anything. It's like people
copying music on tapes and giving it to friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software links users to various servers run by
Napster Inc. People can easily search for any MP3-formated song
stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users. When
selected, the songs are copied from one computer to another.
</P>
<P>
   This vast ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing network has the ability
to find almost any recorded song in the world, from the latest
Britney Spears top-10 pop hit to an obscure 19th century folk song.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry complained that the ability to download
free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and
distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the
musical world. The Recording Industry Association of America
estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in
lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   A new study released Wednesday by online research firm Jupiter
Communications Inc. called Napster ``the definitive killer
application for the online music industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Russell Frackman, representing the
recording companies, said Napster would grow to 75 million users
downloading billions of songs by the end of the year if left
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement
that has ever existed,'' Frackman said. ``The longer this goes on,
the more impossible it will be for us and, we believe, for the
court, to do anything realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's defense team headed by Boies, who led the U.S.
government's recent successful antitrust prosecution of Microsoft,
relied on legal precedents set by previous court decisions that
allowed VCR owners to copy movies. Napster also said it is
protected by provisions of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act and
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Patel, however, flatly rejected those arguments, saying e-mail
messages by Napster's own founders admit the program was designed
to share ``pirated'' versions of copyright-protected songs.
</P>
<P>
   She also shot down Napster's contention that the program, even
if used for illegal purposes, could be spared because there were
some legal ``fair use'' applications such as a promotional vehicle
for unknown new artists.
</P>
<P>
   That argument appeared ``late, after the beginning of this
litigation,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's injunction, intended to prevent any more damage to the
recording industry until after the suit goes to trial, orders
Napster to prevent members from swapping songs controlled by the
record companies that filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Boies argued that the injunction is unfair to Napster because
technicians have not devised a way to separate which songs are
legal. Patel said the injunction will force them to come up with a
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created the monster; I guess that's the consequences they
face,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock band Metallica, was especially
pleased by the ruling. Metallica drew the ire of its fans by filing
its own suit against Napster for allowing the band's songs to be
freely swapped.
</P>
<P>
   With Napster, ``the right of what happens to my music was taken
away from me,'' Ulrich said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the challenge ``is to make people in this country
understand that because technology make it available and because
the Internet gives you access to it, that doesn't mean you have a
right to it''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the ruling gives the recording industry a
clear copyright enforcement victory. But other file sharing
programs like Gnutella that are not controlled by any one company
are going to be harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liability issue against Napster was very clear,'' said
Brian Mudge, partner at Kenyon &AMP; Kenyon in Wash. DC, specializing
in intellectual property cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a whole different ballgame to enforce and
police. The record industry will have to embrace this technology
before it loses total control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of a court-ordered Napster shutdown
looming, Napster fans had already started moving to other
file-sharing programs such as Gnutella, iMesh and Scour, which is
also the subject of another copyright infringement suit by the
motion picture industry.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like  &UR; www.angrycoffee.com  &LR; offer more alternatives,
while  &UR; http://opennap.sourceforge.net  &LR; offers links through outside
servers in case Napster is forced to shut down its own servers.
