   The battle lines are drawn. The target is Napster, the software
company that allows computer users to swap music files with other
users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or
superstars. Either way, the artists don't get royalties _ and this
issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record
labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule
on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner stands Metallica and Dr. Dre _ the heavy metal and
rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against
Napster for copyright infringement. Other artists from Don Henley
to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails are defending their position,
with Henley saying that Napster is engaged in outright ``stealing''
from songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Limp Bizkit, the rap-rock act that has
become Napster's lobbying arm and is taking $1.7 million in Napster
sponsorship to tour this summer. The Offspring and Chuck D of
Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support
of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone
who thinks otherwise is old school.
</P>
<P>
   All of which comes just a week after the Recording Industry
Association of America (on behalf of major labels such as Sony and
Arista) won a lawsuit against MP3.com _ a music database service.
MP3.com was found guilty of copyright infringement for its
my.mp3.com branch, which allows users to create a digital locker
from MP3's database of 80,000 CDs. The RIAA is now asking for
damages that could run in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The subplots to the digital battle are many, and are being
played out in light of increased sales of compact discs. For one,
Metallica has been pitted against some of its fans, one of whom
went on Napster's Web site this week to write that Metallica was a
bunch of ``sellouts.'' He added: ``The (Metallica) song `Master of
Puppets' is fitting, only this time, Metallica is on the wrong end
of the strings.'' Metallica's response was to hire a British firm,
NetPD, to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week,
which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4
million Metallica songs _ an average of nearly five songs per
person _ during that time, said Gayle Fine of the band's management
company, Q Prime. Metallica has asked that Napster drop those names
from its files. As of Thursday, Napster had not removed the names.
One fan posted an angry parody site, www.paylars.com, which asks
fans to send money to the band to pay for songs they downloaded on
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot features Limp Bizkit's singer-rapper, Fred
Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records,
whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate
lawsuit against Napster. Interscope has not commented on what it
thinks of Durst's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger issue has nothing to do with opposing rock
personalities. It has to do with whether 200 years of copyright law
will be thrown out the window by the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry is not anti-Napster,'' says Jayson
Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA. ``Nobody is trying to keep an
unsigned band from getting its music heard. But the RIAA is
concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not
want to give away their music for free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the artist. You're messing with the record
companies now and they don't want to lose that money,'' adds J.C.
Chasez of the band 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA
fight its battles, though more and more artists are speaking out.
The lesser-known ones tend to defend Napster, for as Bill Janovitz
of Buffalo Tom says, ``For artists that nobody has heard of,
Napster may help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger the act, the more likely it is to bash Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I create my music; it's mine,'' said Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
in a recent phone interview. ``It's not your right to give it away
or exchange it with your friends, just as it's not right to copy
software or photocopy books to give away. It represents the
artist's work. Just because a technology exists where you can
duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.
There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of
stuff, that's fine. But it's not everybody's right. Once I record
something, it's not public domain to give it away freely. So I
stand behind Dr. Dre and Metallica and support them. And that's not
trying to be the outdated musician who is trying to stop
technology. I love technology. Technology is here to stay and I'm
the first one downloading the newest update to software that I
don't need and that makes my machine not work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bizkit's Durst, Reznor blasted him by saying, ``Durst is
the brain trust of all that is wrong with music. He supports
(Napster) because they gave him $2 million to tour. He forgot to
mention that in his press release.'' (Bizkit was unavailable for
comment since he's in the studio, said publicist Jenny Bodi.)
</P>
<P>
   Singer Don Henley is equally outspoken. ``The bottom line is
this: The works of recording artists are being stolen and
disseminated over the Internet without fair and just compensation
for those artists,'' he said. ``This is the way songwriters and
singers make their living, and stealing that music and giving it
away for free is not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the absurd argument that `Well, rock stars are
wealthy, and therefore, it's all right to steal from them,' '' said
Henley. ``But the majority of singers and songwriters and recording
artists in this business are not wealthy. They're struggling hand
to mouth, day to day, and they need fair and just compensation for
their work. I'm deeply concerned, as are all artists about these
issues, particularly Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning, a 19-year-old
then-Northeastern University student who dropped out after his
freshman year to move to San Mateo, Calif., where the company is
based. Napster is growing dramatically _ spokeswoman Deborah Orr
won't put a figure on the number of users, but cites ``millions,
with a 5 to 25 percent increase every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm refers to itself as the ``embattled MP3 file-swapping
software company.'' Clearly, there's a martyrdom complex here,
though Fanning and other Napster executives weren't available to
discuss it for this article. Orr said, ``they can't comment on
anything touching on the lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow
in climbing aboard the digital revolution, hence the
fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3.com.
Earlier this week Sony and Universal Music announced plans to
launch a joint music download subscription service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new company, myplay.com, has been working with
labels on a ``totally legal basis,'' says founder David Pakman, who
worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer. His company
enables users to have a digital locker of songs, but royalties are
paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks
but can't copy them. Myplay will launch a partnership with aol.com
in two weeks, so the timing is perfect for this new startup, now
that Napster and my.mp3.com have been scarred by lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   While most artists have chosen sides in the Napster dispute,
some artists are still sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can argue on both sides, but not hard enough to do anything
about it,'' said solo and Throwing Muses singer Kristin Hersh. ``I
want music to get to more ears than just through MTV, Top 40 radio,
and Rolling Stone. So something that opens things up and makes
people more musically educated can be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A wait-and-see policy was voiced by Billy Corgan of the Smashing
Pumpkins. ``It's a waste of time to go after (Napster) because
you're not going to be able to stop free trade on the Internet.
Everybody should stop wringing their hands about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take two or three years to sort itself out,''
said Corgan. ``It's going to be the future, but we'll eventually
have to figure out a system that gives the artist some copyright
payment. I believe it's hurting record sales, but it's also doing
what it's supposed to do _ building new fans.''
