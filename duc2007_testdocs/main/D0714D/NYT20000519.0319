 FIRM BLOCKS WORKERS' USE OF NAPSTER  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The crackdown on Napster has reached the
corporate workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked
employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping
program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of
Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth
problems. But Napster officials said there have been only a few
scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine''
of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and
has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice
Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices,
including one in San Francisco. The message: Napster is officially
off-limits at work.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information
systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came
when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one
office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc. in San Mateo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to
Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other
business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems
backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no
longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the
operation. Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded
about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like potato chips, you can't download just one,'' Buss
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software, created by founder Shawn Fanning, allows
music fans to share their MP3-formatted songs directly with other
Napster members without cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica
and rap star Dr. Dre have sued Napster claiming the program
promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 universities have enacted highly publicized bans or
restrictions on Napster because student file-swapping was clogging
the institutions' high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Three colleges, Yale University, Indiana University and the
University of Southern California, blocked Napster to avoid getting
drawn into Metallica's copyright infringement lawsuit against
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s have flourished at universities because they afford
students free access to high-speed Internet connections. A survey
this week by Greenfield Online showed 75 percent of college
students have downloaded music from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses also have those same high-speed connections. ``It
would make sense that people are using Napster at work,'' said
David Gould, who operates an independent Web site called
NapsterMP3.com, which offers Napster fans forums and news, but not
MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   Gould of Charlotte, N.C., said he has heard of no other company
bans of Napster. However, he said that about 20 percent of the
visitors logged on to his site yesterday morning were from
business-related Internet addresses, and that percentage seems to
go up on Mondays when workers return after the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said visitors to his 3-week-old site yesterday included
users from financial services companies, the military, media
outlets and the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool had no specific information of other
companies that cracked down on Napster use. However, he said the
bans had more to do with workers slacking off than computer
resource problems.
