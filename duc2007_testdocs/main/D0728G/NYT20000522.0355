   NEW ORLEANS _ Responding to reports that the highly-touted
anticancer drug endostatin has failed to impress in its first human
tests, Dr. Judah Folkman of Children Hospital in Boston told
thousands of cancer specialists Monday that he was ``very pleased''
with the drug's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be
more good news ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting, Folkman, who developed endostatin in
Boston labs, urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs
don't work right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it takes a long time . . .,'' Folkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer
specialists about the drug's effectiveness since a National Cancer
Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month
saying ``no dramatic benefits,'' have been seen in endostatin
trials going on now in Boston and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
   That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc.,
which makes endostatin, into a tailspin. Investors have been
closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's
progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman
would cure cancer within two years. That hasn't happened but the
enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented
as they await results of the endostatin trials.
</P>
<P>
   Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study
in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed
to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.
Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which
no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about
them. However, he said Monday ``We are very pleased with the
results at the Boston hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called
angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to
be powerful cancer fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly,
angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly
strangles them, or at least halts their growth.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly
children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.
``If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager
who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all
therapies. She had been ``sent home to die,'' Folkman said, but
after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the
growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only
because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when
specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt
her tumor's growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in
constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were
increasingly numb as the tumor grew.
</P>
<P>
   Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually
prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that
is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor. It is also effective in blocking
a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more
blood vessels. Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of
a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer
size.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it
wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the
tumor seemed to have stabilized. ``It was the first time it had
done something other than grow,'' said Kalesnik, who is taking a
break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent,
and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within
a few months. Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in
small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard
way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.
In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be
effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but
treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening
growths, called hemangiomas. Folkman showed slides of infants with
enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood
vessels. These life-threatening growths, which also produce
substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also
responded well to interferon treatment, he said. Previously, no
other anticancer treatment had worked.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of
angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer. Most have been inconclusive but
some show promise that will be explored in wider testing.
