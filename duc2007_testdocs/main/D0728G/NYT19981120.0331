   Sex at a molecular level is spawning an elite class of proteins.
Maxygen, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., has used a DNA shuffling
technique to create interferons that are dramatically more
effective against viruses than any produced naturally by the immune
system. It has also made ultra-efficient versions of an industrial
enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   When organisms reproduce sexually, the offspring end up with a
mix-and-match set of genes inherited from both parents. Maxygen's
technique is similar, except the parents are a series of related
genes. These are cut into pieces, shuffled together and then
assembled to form a new genetic generation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these daughter genes can manufacture proteins that are
much better at certain tasks than nature's originals. The best ones
can be screened out and shuffled to produce whole lineages of
superior descendants, in a process mimicking evolution by natural
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen's technique was described earlier this year in Nature
(vol. 391, p. 288). Now its potential is beginning to be realized.
The parent genes are first broken into fragments by shattering
their DNA with ultrasound, or cutting them up with an enzyme called
DNAse. They are reassembled into daughter genes, comprising
fragments from several parents, using a variant of the DNA-building
polymerase chain reaction. Short template or ``primer'' sequences
ensure that the fragments are stitched together in the correct
order to produce a functioning gene. The daughter genes can then be
inserted into bacteria or fungi, where they begin making protein.
</P>
<P>
   To make superior versions of an industrial enzyme, the identity
of which is still secret, Maxygen's scientists isolated genes from
26 microorganisms which each make their own versions of the enzyme.
Using its system of DNA shuffling, Maxygen made 600 new daughter
genes, 77 of which produced superior enzymes. Screening showed up
variants which functioned better than natural enzymes at high, low
or intermediate pH. Others were more resistant to solvents or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all highly significant commercially,'' says Pim
Stemmer, Maxygen's vice-president of research.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen has also shuffled genes that make the 20 known human
interferons. This time they made 2,000 daughter genes _ and once
again, the results were spectacular. The best interferon produced
by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b,
which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect
cultured cells against a mouse virus.
</P>
<P>
   It could prove a major moneyspinner for Maxygen. Sales of
interferon alpha-2b, which is used to treat viral diseases and
cancer, pull in $600 million each year for Schering-Plough of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   At present the most popular method of coaxing genes into making
new versions of proteins is random mutagenesis, in which
ultraviolet light or a DNA-disrupting chemical makes genes mutate.
But most of these mutations are damaging, with typically only 1
percent yielding genes that make improved proteins. By comparison,
13 percent of the enzymes Maxygen produced through DNA shuffling
were superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA shuffling is a very powerful technology,'' says Andy
Ellington of the University of Texas at Austin, who is currently
comparing the technique with random mutagenesis.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even necessary to know the identity of all the genes
which might profitably be ``mated'' with one another, Stemmer says.
Fragments of DNA from a known gene can be used to trawl genomes of
other species for related genes. &QL;
