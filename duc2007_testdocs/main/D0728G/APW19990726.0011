	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A pharmacy that has had to turn away hepatitis  
C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only treatment 
available has started selling the drugs itself at half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in  
Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month. 
Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N.J.-based 
Schering-Plough Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and  
still not be able to afford the drug?'' said Don Kerrish, one of 
the three druggists who own the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9  
million people in the United States. It can lead to chronic liver 
problems, including cirrhosis and cancer. There is no vaccine 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of  
Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the 
virus. The company uses a type of interferon called Intron A, the 
only type approved for use with Ribavirin for treating hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately,  
an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmacists said they have received about 10 calls a day  
from potential patients since they started the sales July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell  
their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and  
Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together 
just to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors and patients need to have the access and flexibility  
to make the choices they deem appropriate, not the drug company,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's president of U.S. marketing, Richard Zahn,  
denied the accusation: ``I think we're a company that cares about 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has asked the FDA to look into whether Fisher's  
is violating federal guidelines. By promoting the drugs, the 
pharmacy is moving toward manufacturing, which is not allowed, 
Schering-Plough claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrish said the pharmacy is meeting federal regulations and  
selling safe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough says its treatment -- which earned $248 million  
in the 12 months ending May 1999 -- is the only one proven to work. 
However, the company says it is effective in only about 40 percent 
of the people who take it.
