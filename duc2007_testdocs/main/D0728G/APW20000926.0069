<HEADLINE> Study: Early Treatment Can Limit MS  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the drugs used to control multiple sclerosis also sharply
slows the rate at which people develop the crippling nerve disease,
according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, from an international study halted early because
the results were so strong, could help thousands of patients who
currently don't get treatment until they have substantial brain or
nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important finding because it really shows if one
starts treatment early on, one can change the fate of a patient,''
delaying or even preventing the onset of the disease, said Dr.
Thomas Leist, director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis
Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It opens up a new perspective about treatment of multiple
sclerosis,'' said Leist, who was not involved in the study, which
will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, people who suffer inflammation of nerves in the eye,
spinal cord or lower brain -- indications that MS might be
developing -- have not been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder,
let alone treated. The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up
elsewhere in the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers at the State University of New York School
of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites
concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a
within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of
developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh
injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared
with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will
push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in
patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   If brain lesions -- scarring that indicates past inflammation --
are spotted during the MRI, Reingold said, ''it should encourage
treatment with this interferon.''
</P>
<P>
   In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and
attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective
''insulation'' coating nerve fibers. That damage builds up over
years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or
blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some people merely suffer mild weakness for decades, while
others steadily worsen from repeated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation
during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce
the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex,
is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human
protein, said the lead researcher, Dr. Lawrence Jacobs, professor
of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo
General Hospital. It works by reducing inflammation and quieting
down the overactive immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of
new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than
half, compared with patients in the comparison group. It also cut
the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91
percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on
Avonex's effects when it is used early.
</P>
<P>
   The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve
flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI,
Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains,
they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve
flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients,
something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that
are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth
of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be
helped by aggressive treatment. Leist said its price tag of about
$10,000 annually could limit use.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than
three years to determine how long they need the interferon
treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if
there are similar benefits when given earlier.
