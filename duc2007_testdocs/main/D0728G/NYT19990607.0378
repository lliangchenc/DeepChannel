DRUG REGIMEN CREDITED WITH BEATING AGGRESSIVE TUMOR

<P>
   BOSTON _ It started with an earache. But in a scenario every
parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually
proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so
aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost
as menacing.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the
tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed
it. At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and
her teeth were pushed out of place. Surgeons resorted to removing
half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor
grew back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period
in 1994. ``We were thinking, now what?''
</P>
<P>
   Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it
would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other
side grew normally.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr. Leonard Kaban
of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr. Judah Folkman,
head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich
in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off
the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics,
Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally
beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that
knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical
meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that
Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called
basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). He suspected that
Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic
factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to
sprout new vessels to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon
alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down
overproduction of FGF.
</P>
<P>
   The test showed that Folkman was right. Her blood contained many
times the normal amount of FGF. ``That was exciting, because now we
had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having
the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low
dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in
large doses. ``We started giving her small injections at night, and
by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment
when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around
the house,'' said her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon
treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels
of FGF fell. That was strong evidence that the interferon was
shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of
new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised
because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
Tuesday, Jennifer is 9. The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor,
appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown,
somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know
it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong.'' The LaChances live in
Lincoln, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of
the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis _ the
growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six
other cases, says Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back
during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible
isn't clear, said Kaban. She is still missing all her lower teeth
on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she
can have implants put in when she's older.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues
at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show
enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman
says. Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a
long period. That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger
angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and
angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to
control cancer.
