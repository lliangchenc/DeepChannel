<HEADLINE> Kenya to Adopt New Education System in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's controversial 8-4-4
education system is to be replaced with a new school program by
January 2001, according to a report submitted by the country's
Education Commission of Inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation reported Friday that Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi Thursday asked the Ministry of Education, Science and
Technology to appoint a task force to implement the proposals put
forward by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Details about the report were not available, but the commission
is believed to have called for changes to the 8-4-4 system, which
means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and
four years of university.
</P>
<P>
The current system, introduced 14 years ago, has been widely
criticized by parents and teachers for its heavy workload. It is
too broad, too expensive and too troublesome, they complained.
