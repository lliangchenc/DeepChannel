<HEADLINE> Pupil Enrollment Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual gross enrollment in
Kenya's primary schools fell by two percent to 55 percent this
year mainly due to the introduction of cost-sharing in schools,
which has locked out children from poor background.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 23 percent of the pupils enrolled in the country's
16,000 primary schools dropped out before reaching grade five
between 1990 and 1995, according to a lastest Human Development
Report.
</P>
<P>
The decline was also a result of lack of adequate teaching
facilities and qualified teachers in many schools in the eastern
African country, the local press quoted the report as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
The requirement that children must go to school in uniform,
buy a variety of textbooks and pay numerous levies and fees have
also contributed to the drop in school enrollment, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's adult illiteracy rate was sharply down to
21.9 percent in 1995 from about 35 percent in previous years,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan Education Director Sammy Kyungu said the
government has drafted guidelines to liberalize the education
sector in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, procurement of textbooks, supply and
distribution would be school-based rather than dependent on the
Kenya Institute of Education, he said on Thursday.
