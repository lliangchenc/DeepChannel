<HEADLINE> USDA Redefines `Organic' Labels </HEADLINE>

	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- In a reversal, the government is  
planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any 
food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with 
antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last  
year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too 
permissive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to  
protect the integrity of your industry,'' said Keith Jones of the 
Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is developing the first national standards on  
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and 
industry guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually  
for the last seven years. In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms  
trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming 
Research Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call  
organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,  
herbicides or preservatives. Livestock should be raised in open-air 
environments, without antibiotics or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the organic farmers defeated USDA proposals to allow  
irradiation, genetic engineering and sewage sludge in organic 
production. The original rules also would have permitted 
applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000  
protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
withdraw the proposal and try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones shared key details of the department's latest proposals  
Thursday with the nation's largest gathering of organic farmers at 
the Ecological Farming Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding a hand-drawn paper target to his chest, he conceded that  
the federal agency has failed the organic farmers in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in the current environment the USDA can't do  
anything right,'' he said. ``But I can tell you today we have a 
commitment to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a generally sympathetic reception.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob  
Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is on the 
National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers. 
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farmers were skeptical that his verbal assurances  
may not hold once rules are published again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but  
we still believe in it. That's kind of where we are in this 
process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for 
Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,''  
said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a 
Santa Fe, N.M. company. ``For many of us, this is a continuation of 
a lifetime of work. First it was civil rights. Then it was 
anti-war. Now it's food security.''
