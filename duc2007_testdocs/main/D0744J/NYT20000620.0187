BRITAIN STOCKS UP ON MAINSTREAM ORGANICS 
</HEADLINE>

   When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving
the Americans in the dust. After sputtering along for years, sales
there are expected to be five times as much this year as in 1996,
compared with a less than threefold increase in this country over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Organics are mainstream in Britain, in some part because of the
introduction of genetically modified ingredients from America to
which there has been widespread opposition. Anger and fear over GM
products reached a peak last summer and has since died down, but
interest in organics is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ads for organic food are found in newspapers and in supermarket
magazines, particularly those of Waitrose and Sainsbury, the two
chains leading the organic charge. Overhead signs in their stores
direct customers to the organic sections, and the products
themselves are clearly marked. That these organic products are free
of genetically modified ingredients is occasionally emblazoned on
the packages as well.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the United States, where the bulk of organic sales
are in natural food stores, 70 percent to 80 percent of the sales
in England are in conventional supermarkets. Sainsbury has about
440 stores, and Waitrose has more than 120. Other supermarket
chains are also making a point of stocking organic ingredients, but
not with quite the same fervor.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors account for the differences between the two
countries. The simple answer is a series of food scares there that
have made consumers uneasy. ``We have lived in a culture of food
scares,'' said Alan Wilson, an agronomist and organic food
consultant for Waitrose, citing organophosphates in carrots,
salmonella in eggs and BSE in cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The latter refers to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, which destroys the brain. For several years, the
British government insisted that it could not be passed from cattle
to humans. Then, in 1997, the government acknowledged that BSE
could be transmitted. The admission was followed by the appearance
of genetically modified foods, and for Britons that apparently was
the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the furor last year over genetically modified foods
occurred because ``it threatened to take away choice from British
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Any science that comes to market has to benefit
consumers, and the presentation of GM foods here was very, very
poor. So GM was just another gift to the organic movement,''
helping to speed up its popularity. As in the United States,
organic means free of genetically modified ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite food scares in the United States _ salmonella in
chickens and eggs, listeria in ready-to-eat meats and E. coli
O157:H7 in a number of products _ Americans appear to trust
government food safety agencies more than the British.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sams, an American who is founder and president of Whole
Earth Foods in England and lives there but travels often to the
United States, said there were three fundamental differences
between attitudes here and there: regulations, the press and the
English connectedness to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   He could have added vegetarianism. For generations, meatless
diets have had a much higher profile in England than in this
country, where few even knew what vegetarians were until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no national organic standards, Sams said,
which ``undermines the market and deters big companies from going
in.'' When the European Union's organic rules took effect in 1993,
it improved credibility, he said, ``because everyone knew what
organic meant.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, the press has been very supportive of organics, Sams
said. Food writers there are continually exposed to information
from the Soil Association, which is a nationwide organic certifier
and has as much clout as all of this country's organic institutions
combined.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, Sams believes that the British are more connected
to their environment. ``The English love to go for long rambling
walks in the countryside,'' he said. ``You don't do that in the
States, so you don't have the same sense of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade
Association in Greenfield, Mass., the country's largest organic
organization, agreed with Sams' assessment. In addition, she said,
supermarkets have not been around as long as they have in the
United States, and so the ``British still feel the loss of
neighborhood green grocer, the butcher, the baker,'' DiMatteo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how people would be very emotional about their
food supply, and organic seems to answer these kinds of emotional
concerns and issues,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The deep involvement of Prince Charles in organics and genetic
engineering issues has also not been lost on his subjects, she
said, and he has developed a line of organic foods under the Duchy
label.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because of Britain's size, trends spread more rapidly
there. ``Even if you wanted to buy organic in many parts of this
country,'' DiMatteo said, ``you wouldn't be able to except on the
West and East Coasts, the upper Midwest and the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   On my visit to London in May, I was coming out of the
underground when I was confronted by a front-page headline in The
Daily Mail. It warned, ``Organic Mushrooms Were Contaminated With
Deadly Bacteria.'' Not until the fifth paragraph did the reader
learn that the headline was false, that the E. coli found in the
mushrooms was not E. coli 0157:H7, which is deadly, but the generic
variety, which is not. No sources were cited for the findings. Only
one of Britain's many newspapers repeated any part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   These weren't the first false charges. Last year, according to
The Guardian, the ``agri-industrial food establishment'' mounted
``an ill-informed and unjustified smear campaign'' that tried to
link organic food to the hazardous form of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   The thriving organic movement in Britain must have agribusiness
and biotech industry worried.
