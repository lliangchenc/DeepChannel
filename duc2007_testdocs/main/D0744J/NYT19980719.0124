<P>
   American shoppers would be surprised to know that much of the
food they buy has genetically engineered ingredients. But they
cannot tell just how much, because the United States, unlike many
other countries, does not require the labeling of gene-modified
food.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers are unaware of the amount of genetically
engineered food that is available, making it difficult to judge
their resistance to such products.
</P>
<P>
   When the government granted Monsanto Co. permission to sell
rBGH, recombinant bovine growth hormone, which increases cows' milk
production, and milk containing a gene-altered hormone went on
sale, some states and several dairies tried to label their products
as free of the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto threatened to take them to court. Some capitulated. But
a number of dairy products are now labeled to show that they do not
contain rBGH.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few consumer groups seeking wider labeling, the
greatest awareness of genetically engineered food comes from the
organic-food industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Texas, which has 91
supermarkets in 18 states, requires its suppliers to guarantee that
none of the products they sell to the company have gene-altered
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national
standards for organic food that included genetically altered food,
more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed
regulations. The inclusion of genetically modified food was one of
the reasons most often cited, and the proposal was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the government gave the green light to genetically
modified soybeans, cotton, corn, summer squash, potatoes, canola
oil, radicchio, papayas and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of genetically modified soybeans, cotton and corn on
the market is significant. According to one study, the gene-altered
corn crop in the United States this summer is estimated to be 32
percent of the total, for soybeans 38 percent and for canola oil,
from Canada, 58 percent. There is no estimate for cotton.
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures for the smaller crops like papaya and
radicchio, and just because a crop has approval does not mean that
it is being sold. But within a year or two such crops are quite
likely to be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union, the Environmental Defense Fund and the
Center for Science in the Public Interest are among those pushing
for labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Norway and India are leading the fight to require the strictest
labeling on all foods. And virtually all European Union countries
want some labeling for gene-altered food.
</P>
<P>
   A senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, Rebecca
Goldberg, said the United States might be forced to require some
labeling because of international trade. ``Many products made
abroad,'' Ms. Goldberg said, ``will be labeled, and in order for
the United States to sell food products abroad we may have to label
them.''
