<HEADLINE> EPA Is Sued Over Gene-Altered Crops </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing trend of genetically altering crops  
with an ingrown biological pesticide is too risky for the 
environment, a coalition of environmentalists and organic farmers 
charged in a lawsuit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to force the government to end its approval of what  
are known as Bt crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by Greenpeace  
International, the Center for Food Safety and the International 
Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges the 
Environmental Protection Agency with ``wanton destruction'' of Bt, 
which it calls the ``world's most important biological pesticide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another short term fix that industry is willing  
to use up,'' said Jane Rissler, a senior scientist with the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Kalee Kreider, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, ``These crops are  
an environmental disaster waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complainants are concerned that using the pesticide in  
genetically altered plants poses environmental risks that will 
change the ecological balance as well as hurt organic farmers who 
don't want to use genetically-altered products. They complain that 
EPA has failed to address their concerns since approving the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA approved the use of Bt in potatoes in 1995 and has since  
agreed to its use in corn and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit demands that EPA cancel registration of all  
genetically engineered Bt plants; cease approval of any new Bt 
plants and immediately perform an environmental impact assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer sit idly by,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal  
director for the Center for Food Safety. ``EPA has shown a blatant 
disregard for federal law and its own regulations by approving Bt 
crops without fully assessing their environmental safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bt is actually a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that  
produces toxins to kill insects. It has been used for years as a 
spray by farmers and gardeners who like the fact that it kills 
insects while remaining nontoxic to mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the use of Bt has changed in recent years with advances in  
genetic engineering. Scientists are now able to develop plants that 
contain a gene for Bt toxin, giving the crops built-in protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been controversial, however, as many groups have  
raised concerns that insects will become resistant to Bt, which 
would seriously hurt organic farmers who are permitted to use Bt 
insecticides as their only emergency pest control option. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA spokesman defended the agency's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``EPA carefully makes sure that the biotech products we review  
fully comply with all legal requirements designed to ensure that 
they are environmentally sound and environmentally beneficial,'' 
said spokesman Dave Cohen. ``We believe the actions we've taken 
with regard to Bt will be sustained against this legal challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some organic farmers say an even bigger threat is pollination  
from the genetically-altered plant seeping from conventional farms 
to organic farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Walker, president of Terra Firma Inc. -- an organic food  
company in Hudson, Wis., said he was forced to recall over $100,000 
worth of organic tortilla chips that had been contaminated with 
genetically-engineered corn. He blames pollination from another 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless Bt corn is withdrawn, it will soon contaminate every  
corn field in the country,'' Walker said.
