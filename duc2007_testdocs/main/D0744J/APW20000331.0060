<HEADLINE> Organic Cropland Doubled in 1990s  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers doubled the nation's organic crop
acreage in the 1990s, and production of organic eggs and milk
increased even more to meet rising consumer demand, the government
says.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of certified organic cropland grew from 403,000 acres
in 1992 to 850,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of organic laying hens jumped from 43,981 to 537,826
during the same period, a time when public concern about bacterial
contamination of eggs was on the rise. The number of organic milk
cows grew from 2,265 to 12,897.
</P>
<P>
   ''Organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of
U.S. agriculture during the 1990s and producers, exporters and
retailers are still struggling to meet consumer demand,'' according
to a study by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farming is still a very small part of U.S. agriculture,
however. About 0.2 percent of U.S. cropland was certified organic
in 1997, compared with 1.5 percent in Europe, where farmers are
offered government aid to convert to organic agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of organic pasture and rangeland actually declined
from 1992 to 1997, from 532,000 acres to 496,000 acres. Economists
say organic production of meat and poultry lagged during the decade
because they could not be labeled as organic until February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the USDA study was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in
livestock. New national standards for organic food that the
department announced earlier this month are expected to stimulate
growth in the industry by bolstering consumer confidence and making
it easier to export the products.
</P>
<P>
   But the study said it remains difficult for farmers to switch to
organic practices for a number of reasons: the cost and risk
involved in shifting to the new methods, insufficient numbers of
processors and distributors, and limited access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   While organic products can fetch significantly higher prices
than conventional ones, farmers cannot sell their crops as organic
during the three-year conversion period required to be certified.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 2 percent of apple, grape, lettuce and carrot
acreage was organic in 1997, along with 1 percent of oats, dry peas
and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that organic agriculture has continued to
expand since 1997. California Certified Organic Farmers, one of the
top certifying agencies in the state, estimated its 1999 acreage at
96,878, up 38 percent from 1997. Idaho estimated its 1999 organic
cropland at 85,061 acres, up 55 percent from 1997.
