<HEADLINE> USDA Plans Organic Food Standards  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal rules for organic food will assure
consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same
standards nationwide. That doesn't mean, however, that organic is
better than conventional food, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because something is labeled organic does not mean that
it is any more superior, any safer or more healthy than
conventional food. All food in this country must meet the same high
standards of safety, regardless of their classification,'' Glickman
said in releasing the proposed rules Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, almost a decade in the making, would bar the use of
genetically engineered crops, disease-killing irradiation
treatments or industrial sludge as a fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Products grown and processed according to the standards and
contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to
carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic.''
Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made
with'' organic ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards, intended to replace a hodgepodge of state and
private rules, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in
livestock production and require the use of organic feed. The rules
also restrict the kind of fertilizers, pesticides and food
additives that can be used. With a few exceptions, synthetic
chemicals would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national
organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and
others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected
to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules ''will preserve the well-defined production
practices that characterize organic agriculture,'' said Hiu
Newcomb, who runs organic vegetable farms in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Food Processors Association said USDA ignored
scientific evidence in deciding to block the use of genetically
engineered crops or irradiation. Conventional meat and produce can
be irradiated to kill harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the public's views are important, rules governing food
labeling and food safety must be based on sound science, and sound
science cannot be determined by public opinion polling,'' said
Kelly Johnston, a spokeswoman for the group, which represents major
food processors and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, who wrote a 1990 law that required USDA to
develop the rules, said they should provide a boost to the organic
industry, which has already been growing by 20 percent a year.
Without such standards, ''there are limits to consumer acceptance
and export potential,'' the Vermont Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of the rules will be left to states and private
certifying agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic,
only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency.
</P>
<P>
   USDA will take public comment on the rules from March 13 through
June 14 before putting them into effect. Farmers and processors
will then be given 18 months to get into compliance.
