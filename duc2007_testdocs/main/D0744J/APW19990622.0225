<HEADLINE> Can Customers Trust Organic Label? </HEADLINE>

	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Consumers will pay more for food they  
believe to be free of pesticides and grown in an a way that 
protects the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they trust it?  
</P>
<P>
	The growth of organic food from a fringe movement to a $5  
billion nationwide industry is based mostly on trust. 
</P>
<P>
	When a label says ``grown and processed in accordance with the  
California Organic Foods Act of 1990,'' it does not necessarily 
mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods 
industry, farmers, inspectors and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the food also has been independently certified, they say,  
it's likely no one has checked to ensure the food meets minimum 
state standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The savvy customer knows that if it isn't certified, it isn't  
organic,'' said Route 1 Farms owner Jonathan Steinberg, who grows 
$1 million of mixed vegetables a year on 120 rented acres in Santa 
Cruz County and has been certified since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	To sell something as organic, growers have to register with the  
state and pay an annual fee -- from $25 for under $10,000 in sales 
to $2,000 for $5 million or more. Sellers of processed foods pay 
just $100 for an entire line of products. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have to keep extensive paperwork showing the food is  
free from pesticides and synthetic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	But until recently, the California Department of Food and  
Agriculture hasn't done much more than look into complaints, which 
have been rare. And the Department of Health Services, which 
inspects processed food, has yet to set up an organic compliance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you register with the state there are basically no  
on-site inspections. They come out and say 'yup, you're organic,' 
end of story,'' said vegetable grower Dick Peixoto of Watsonville. 
``Most customers want that assurance that you're actually being 
monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal organic law -- more than a decade in the planning --  
will require certification as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, most major supermarkets have acted on their own.  
About 85 percent of the fruits and vegetables sold by California's 
2500 registered organic growers, packers and shippers is now 
certified. 
</P>
<P>
	But most national retailers -- including such natural food chains  
as Whole Foods Market -- still don't require certification for 
processed food. 
</P>
<P>
	With the industry growing by 20 percent a year, the state  
agriculture department's budget has grown to $350,000 -- enough for 
500 inspections this year, and for the first time, random, 
unannounced soil and tissue samplings, program director Ray Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the industry remains small enough for organic violators  
to be easily discovered, and by all accounts, fraud rarely occurs. 
When it does, Green avoids fines or criminal charges, unless the 
fraud seems intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	One such incident involved San Diego-based Petrou Foods Inc.,  
which was caught selling olive oil as organic when some of the 
olives were actually harvested from a golf course. That 
investigation resulted in a felony conviction and $10,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's doing something that's not right, the whole  
industry learns about it. And believe me, that can be more 
detrimental than anything else,'' said Margaret Wittenberg, an 
executive at Whole Foods.
