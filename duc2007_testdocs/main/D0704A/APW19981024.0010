Amnesty International criticizes South Korea

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ London-based human rights group
Amnesty International accused the South Korean government Saturday
of trying to control what was supposed to be an independent
national human rights commission.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has promised to launch a watchdog
commission to monitor human rights violations by police,
prosecutors, intelligence officials and other government agencies.
	   But according to the Justice Ministry's draft law, most of the
commission members will be government officials or people
recommended by the justice minister and appointed by the president.
	   The draft legislation ``does not in its present form conform to
international human rights standards. It would result in a
commission which lacks independence and investigative powers,''
Amnesty International Secretary General Pierre Sane said in an open
letter to President Kim.
	   ``We are therefore extremely concerned that the government ...
intends to secure adoption of this law without adequate public
consultation,'' said the letter, a copy of which was faxed to The
Associated Press.
	   On Tuesday, Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon said the government
plan was ``just a draft'' and more public consultation will follow.
	   President Kim, who had himself been persecuted by former
authoritarian leaders, became the first opposition leader to win
the presidency after emerging victorious from elections last
December.
	   He has since promised to promote human rights.
