<HEADLINE> American Home Pushes Drug Settlement  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a major step toward resolving health claims
against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American
Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted
out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market in 1997 due to links with serious heart problems, but
just 45,000 of them have elected to refuse the $3.75 billion
settlement, American Home said Thursday, adding it has decided to
go ahead with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   March 30 was the deadline for fen-phen users to opt out. Those
who did so retain the right to sue American Home for punitive
damages. If too many people had opted out, American Home could have
scrapped the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, reached last October, would pay individual fen-phen
users up to $1.5 million. Most, however, would get far less,
depending on their level of injury and how long they took the
drugs. It includes money to pay patients who say they were injured
by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are
still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   So far more than 9,000 suits have been filed against American
Home by fen-phen users, imposing a major obstacle for the company
as it tries to win back trust of investors who have seen its stock
drop because of the litigation and problems with other medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation has also hurt the company's efforts to find a
merger partner. American Home lost its bid to buy rival
Warner-Lambert Co. in part because of uncertainty surrounding the
diet drug litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The national settlement still must be approved by a judge. A
hearing is scheduled in federal court in Philadelphia on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, N.J.-based American Home made fenfluramine, the ''fen''
in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of
Pondimin. It also made Redux, a chemical cousin. In September 1997,
the drugs were removed from the market after a Mayo Clinic study
linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The second
drug in the combination, phentermine, is still on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in
the United States, whether or not they filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of opt outs is well within the expected range for a
nationwide settlement of this magnitude and the company is
confident that it can continue to manage this level of opt outs,''
said Louis Hoynes Jr., American Home's senior vice president. The
company said most of those who opted out of the deal aren't sick.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the opt-outs have yet to sue American Home, raising the
prospect of thousands of new suits.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company showed little concern about this.
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience with litigation of these types suggests that such
opt outs have generally weaker claims and also may be subject to
statute of limitations defenses,'' American Home said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 drug users registered to participate in the
settlement and many more are expected since a deadline for
registration hasn't yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the response to this settlement represents an
overwhelming endorsement of the settlement as a fair and
appropriate way to remedy the health problems caused by AHP's diet
drugs,'' said Arnold Levin, a plaintiff attorney who helped
negotiate the settlement.
