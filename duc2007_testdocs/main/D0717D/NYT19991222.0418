AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS AGREES TO SETTLEMENT OF MISSISSIPPI FEN-PHEN
CASES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   American Home Products Corp. agreed late Tuesday to pay $350
million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over
its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger
the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a
Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages
to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to
develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts
Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with
Warner-Lambert would be completed. Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile
bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out
American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's
lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, Pfizer's offer for
Warner-Lambert was valued at $72.4 billion, while American Home
Products' bid was $51.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert said in a statement late Wednesday that it
remained committed to its merger with American Home Products. But
Pfizer wasted little time in questioning the wisdom of such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have offered a 41 percent premium over the American Home
Products' offer,'' said Lou Clemente, executive vice president for
corporate affairs at Pfizer. ``That's a $21 billion difference.
That tells us something anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors did not react so negatively to American Home Products'
latest woes. The company's shares fell 56.25 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $40. Warner-Lambert increased $1.125, or 1.4 percent, to
$82.9375. Pfizer's shares rose $1.125, or 4.9 percent, to $33.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think the merger between American Home
Products and Warner-Lambert will go through, but not because of the
Mississippi settlement,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical
analyst with Mehta Partners. ``But it doesn't help. It's just one
more reason Warner-Lambert should not merge with American Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has
yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it. Since Pondimin,
American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen''
in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the
market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people
have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to
settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful. Many analysts
applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did
not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a
federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases
and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to
court. Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the
Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to
pursue their claims in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, American Home Products' global settlement is now
dead,'' said Ed Blizzard, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Houston who is
involved in many fen-phen cases. ``A lot of people won't go into
the national settlement. If you look at that $150 million award, it
just shows you how angry ordinary citizens get when they hear about
these charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the
claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal
environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even
though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only
8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims
pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs. About 500 of the fen-phen
cases filed in Mississippi were from plaintiffs who lived
elsewhere, including places as far away as Maine and Hawaii,
American Home Products said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told
analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was
substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in
earlier news reports. Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout
for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs
would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement. After
the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that
it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster
than if they were to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement
will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with
Waite, Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief
negotiators of the national agreement. ``It is not meant to include
every case in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement in Mississippi won't be American Home Products'
last day in court. The company said that it faces a similar case
next month in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the series of lawsuits filed between Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert regarding Pfizer's hostile takeover bid will begin
Jan. 10 in Delaware Chancery Court.  &QL;
