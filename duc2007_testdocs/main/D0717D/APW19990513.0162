<HEADLINE> Settlement Sought in Diet Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers representing millions of people who used  
the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national 
settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home 
Products Corp., a lawyer confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products  
hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in 
Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, 
whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the negotiations  
today, said American Home Products would pay billions of dollars 
under such a deal. Hill, however, said it was too early to put a 
price tag on a possible settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been several meetings, and a number of different  
proposals and scenarios have been discussed, but there are some 
difficult issues that are going to have to be agreed upon before 
anything of this magnitude can be concluded,'' Hill added. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products spokesman Lowell Weiner declined comment  
on the report this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company reached a settlement in the first trial  
over heart-valve damage from fen-phen, reportedly agreeing to pay 
$500,000 to one plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people contend they developed heart problems after  
taking the drugs. Some 6 million people in the United States used 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wants ``to avoid letting any of these cases go to  
trial and risk a really huge verdict,'' another Houston lawyer, Don 
Bowen, told the Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	A large jury verdict, he said, would ``considerably inflate'' a  
national settlement's price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home  
Products marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- 
and Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine  
and Redux off the market at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request. A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage.The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, 
was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Settlements in at least nine cases, including those of four  
Texans, have resulted in amounts of up to $4.6 million. The company 
must put between $3 billion and $5 billion into a settlement before 
it is acceptable, some lawyers and Wall Street analysts told the 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug maker, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, stated it was aware of 2,615 lawsuits over 
fen-phen as of March 22. Class-action lawsuits are certified in 
Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West 
Virginia.
