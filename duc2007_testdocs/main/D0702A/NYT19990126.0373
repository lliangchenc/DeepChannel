   ATLANTA _ Sixteen-year-old Bryan Taylor wants to be a singer
when he graduates from East Point's Tri-Cities High School (Ga.),
kind of like the guy who is the falsetto in Boyz II Men. But he
didn't have a clue about how to get from singing around the house
to the cover of a compact disc _ until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was one of 700 students from 21 metro high schools who
got a crash course in how to break into the music business at
Grammy in the Schools, a daylong seminar sponsored by the Atlanta
chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (the
folks who bring us the Grammys).
</P>
<P>
   Students, chosen by teachers and counselors for their interest
in music, got to hear from some of the city's top industry
insiders, such as producer Rico Wade (Outkast, Goodie Mob),
engineer Phil Tan (Usher, Mariah Carey, TLC, Jermaine Dupri) and
video producer Fred Taylor (``The Dip''). The hard-work message was
fairly consistent: ``You can't just buy a keyboard and make money;
you may have to cut some grass,'' advised Wade. But panelists also
helped students understand what the word business means when it
comes to making music.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, all they see is the glamour side of the
business, but they don't see all the work,'' said Charles Driebe,
an Atlanta entertainment lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As students realized they were brushing shoulders with heavy
hitters, hands shot up throughout the Rialto Center for the
Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I copyright a song I've written?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does a musician need an attorney?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a gospel singer, but how do I get started?''
</P>
<P>
   Students also were able to attend sessions on songwriting,
composition, artist management, interactive media, entertainment
law, publishing and public relations. With his black cashmere coat,
shaved head and cast of famous friends, Wade captured most of the
attention, which seemed to be a bit of a deja vu experience for the
hot young producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring to look out there and see these kids, because
they look just like me,'' he said, recalling his childhood as an
aspiring musician in southwest Atlanta. ``They are imagining and
dreaming, just like I was when I was that age. It makes me feel
like I have a purpose in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade also ended up giving Bryan, the sophomore from Tri-Cities,
the tryout of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you sing?'' the producer asked from the stage, after
Taylor asked how to get ``discovered.'' Bryan shouted back yeah,
grabbed a microphone and belted out Jagged Edge's ``I Got to Be''
as students gave him a roaring response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sung in public before,'' Bryan said after the
session. ``But I've learned that it's not just the singing. You've
got to work and get an education too.''
