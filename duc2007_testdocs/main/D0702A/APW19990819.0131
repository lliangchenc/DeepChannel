	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A philanthropic foundation wants to reassert  
the value of the arts and culture in the United States by spending 
$50 million over the next five years to arts causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of Pew Charitable Trust is to give money to support  
arts financing, zoning in historic areas and arts curriculum for 
public schools, said Stephen K. Urice, who will direct the Pew 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is about is the long-term health of American  
creativity and the sustainability of American arts and culture,'' 
he said. ``The long-term goal is to strengthen both political and 
economic support for nonprofit culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.7 billion Pew foundation, started by the family owners of  
the Sun Oil Co., says it plans to establish a centralized 
information center for reliable data on all aspects of cultural 
life. It intends to push greater media coverage, in hopes of 
promoting discussions among policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pew will collaborate with museums and other arts institutions to  
build their cultural programs.
