<HEADLINE> Oregon Facing School Funding Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon, with the nation's fastest-growing  
economy and highest SAT scores, is hardly a place where you would 
expect a school funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many schools have overflowing classes, outdated textbooks,  
insufficient supplies and cuts in arts and sports. The Lebanon 
School District has boarded up one school because there's no money 
for repairs, and classes are held in trailers, said Superintendent 
Jim Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doubts that there is a problem should go spend a  
day in a classroom,'' said Gov. John Kitzhaber, who has been 
pushing for a major boost in school funding. ``You've got kids 
trying to learn algebra in classes of 40 students. This isn't the 
kind of system we want our kids to learn in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem evolved over the past decade as voters slashed  
property taxes at the same time academic standards were being 
toughened. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln High School, on the edge of Portland's downtown, has cut  
all music programs. Cellos and basses gather dust in a corner of a 
music room that is now a humanities classroom, with two teachers 
for 86 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many students that the teachers discourage people  
from writing papers,'' said graduating senior Paul Susi. ``They 
don't have time to read 86 papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Economically this country is at the peak of its game,'' Susi  
said. ``How is it that when we are the most prosperous and 
successful that we can't find out how to adequately fund our own 
schools?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Property tax limits passed by voters during the 1990s largely  
left the state in charge of funding schools. The state now pays 
about 80 percent of local schools' costs, compared with 30 percent 
before the tax limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-student spending has increased, but hasn't kept up with  
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	And with statewide enrollment climbing 15 percent during that  
time -- 542,000 children now attend public schools -- classrooms are 
becoming more crowded. The state school boards association says 
class sizes have increased from about 23 students to the 25- to 
27-student range. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Johnson, who has three boys attending Astor Elementary  
in Astoria, said her son Max struggled through first grade because 
there were 31 children in his class. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just too much distraction in that classroom to allow  
him to focus all day,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsor of one property tax limit measure passed in  
1990, activist Don McIntire, said school administrators who 
complain about tough times are crying wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty-five percent of the cost of schools is pay, perks and  
pensions,'' he said. ``The squeeze isn't coming from 
belt-tightening. School budgets are getting fatter faster than we 
can punch new holes in the belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIntire said raises have boosted the average Oregon teacher's  
salary to $42,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, all teachers averaged $39,347 in the 1997-98 school  
year, according to a study released earlier this month by the 
American Federation of Teachers. Oregon was 13th on that list, with 
an average of $42,301 that year; Connecticut ranked first, at 
$51,727. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to large class sizes, there is a lack of up-to-date  
teaching materials, said Bonnie Elliott, who has taught for 30 
years in the Bend-LaPine School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walk into the average classroom, and you'll see a MacIntosh  
computer that's 12 years old,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And teachers say Oregon's cumulative average SAT score of 1,056  
is deceptive because it reflects what today's older students 
learned years ago, not what younger kids are learning now. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcy Matsuo said she spends $1,000 a year of her own money to  
buy books and other supplies for her elementary classes at 
Portland's Smith School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to constantly be begging parents for money,''  
Matsuo said. ``We have the `Run for the Arts,' scrip sales, coupon 
books, a hoop shoot, gift wrap for sale, a school auction, a 
carnival, painted clay pots for sale. ... I think parents have 
reached their limit.''
