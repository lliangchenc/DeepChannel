<HEADLINE> Euro Trading to Begin Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Trading in Europe's new single
currency will begin on Monday as a United States bank and a Dutch
one have offered to quote prices in the euro.
</P>
<P>
Citibank, the world's largest foreign exchange operator, and
ABN-AMRO said that they had planned to quote prices in the euro for
their clients starting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The founder countries of the euro, as the new single currency is
known, are scheduled to adopt new currency while banks and exchanges
will start using euro in all scriptural transactions such as writing
checks, using credit and charge cards, and buying bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
Euro bank notes and coins will become legal tender on January 1,
2002 while national currencies of the euro founder countries stop
circulating completely by July 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The two banks' announcement to offer an unofficial market in the
new single currency before it effectively comes into existence shows a
strong sign that the financial markets have fully accepted the launch
of the euro.
</P>
<P>
The European summit at heads of state and government level is
scheduled to confirm which European Union member states are
eligible to become the original members of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Both the European Parliament and the European council of
economy and finance ministers have approved the recommendation of
the European Commission that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and
Finland be the founding countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is serving the rotating presidency of the
15-nation European Union, and Denmark have opted out of the euro
club whereas Greece and Sweden have been judged by the commission
not economically ready to join in.
</P>
<P>
Once confirmed by Saturday's summit of European heads of state and
government, the 11 euro countries will have to prepare to put 70
billion euro into circulation while pool another 50 billion euro in
the reserve to make the new money impregnable against speculators.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of introducing the euro is estimated to be at 1
to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product of the 11 euro
countries.
