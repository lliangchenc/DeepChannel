<HEADLINE> Barton Victims Had Loaned Him Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were  
among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day 
trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no way of knowing if he had paid them back or whether  
he was going to pay them,'' Detective Mark Walden said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said it was not known if Barton picked his victims before  
opening fire in the two offices on July 29, killing nine and 
injuring 13 before killing himself five hours later. In the days 
leading up to the gunfire, he killed his wife and his two children 
in Stockbridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, one week after Barton's rampage, there was more  
workplace violence. In Pelham, Ala., a man shot two people to death 
at his company's office and then killed a third at a business where 
he used to work. Police charged 34-year-old Alan Eugene Miller of 
Billingsley with three counts of capital murder.

	``To a degree it's really frightening that all of a sudden ...  
someone is copying this,'' said Fred Herder, a day trader who was 
released from the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said that Barton's attack did not consist of random  
shooting, but at times he pulled the trigger at point-blank range 
at people cowering under desks and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note left in the Stockbridge apartment where he killed his  
family, Barton wrote that he planned to live ``just long enough to 
kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the two day trading companies, Montvale,  
N.J.-based All-Tech Investment Group and Houston-based Momentum 
Securities, said loans made to cover margins, or money borrowed to 
buy stock, are common and are usually repaid the next day, with 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  
reported this week that Barton lost $400,000 to $450,000 trading at 
All-Tech and Momentum in the past year. Momentum officials 
previously disclosed that Barton had lost $105,000 since June, 
including $20,000 just days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Herder, who sat next to Barton for the nine months Barton was at  
All-Tech, recalled loaning Barton money once but could not recall 
the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that he lost a considerable amount of money and that  
money may have been one of the issues that possibly caused this to 
happen,'' Walden said. ``But there are a lot of questions that will 
never be answered.''
