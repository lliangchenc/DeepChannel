 &HT;    Details don't solve riddle that was Mark Barton's life
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider, Alan Judd and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ (SET ITAL)``I'm sure the details don't matter. There
is no excuse, no good reason. I am sure no one would understand. If
they could, I wouldn't want them to.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mark Orrin Barton sat down at his computer and wrote
a chillingly elegant confession, the demons that had haunted him
since childhood had consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   As a loner in high school, Barton imagined himself a criminal
mastermind when he broke into a drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   As a business executive, he undermined his success by retreating
behind a wall of paranoia, sabotaging a colleague's work and
belittling his wife to co-workers after she had a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   As a supposedly loving father, he shot his daughter's kitten and
then, feigning concern, led her on a useless search for the missing
pet, which he had already buried.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Barton's slaughter, the largest mass murder in
Georgia history, have become painfully familiar. What remains,
then, is the effort to answer the unanswerable: Why would this
44-year-old man _ why would anyone _ commit such atrocities,
against the woman who loved him, against the children who cherished
him, against casual acquaintances whose only mistake was to be in
the way of his barrage of bullets? A tall, socially awkward
teen-ager at Sumter High School in South Carolina, he dabbled in
drugs in the early 1970s. A whiz at chemistry who didn't care much
for school, Barton tried to use chemicals to extract a hallucinogen
from morning glory seeds, said Milton Grisham, a schoolmate now
living in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ingested a great deal of it. Then he really overdosed. He
had hallucinations and had to go to the emergency room,'' said
Grisham, a psychologist who has worked with rapists and killers.
``It did something very bad to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Barton cut off all his hair and became religious.
</P>
<P>
   Bible in hand, he showed up at Grisham's house, where they had
sometimes played chess. He said he'd found the answers to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make any sense,'' said Grisham. ``I kind of lost
touch with him, he became so strange. The drugs blew him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton was born in Sumter in 1955, but his father, who worked
for the U.S. Air Force, moved the family to Germany for several
years. They returned to Sumter when Mark was 11, and he later
entered Sumter High. It was a tough time for young people in
Sumter, a city of 25,000 where the main employers were Shaw Air
Force Base and a Campbell's Soup plant. Air Force brats who had
traveled their whole lives shared parks with Southern blacks and
whites who had hardly made it out of town.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, forced integration merged the city's black and white
high schools. When students sat with friends in the cafeteria, they
split along the color line. Windows were smashed; school fights
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of tension in the hallways,'' recalled Alan
Feldstott, a member of a group called ``Teens Against
Discrimination,'' perhaps the only integrated club on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone didn't fit into a group and find an identity,''
they could just slide through unnoticed, said retired English
teacher J. Grady Locklear. ``Mark is one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton didn't play sports, didn't have a steady girlfriend,
didn't care much about anything beyond chemistry and math. The kid
with glasses, who drove a gold Plymouth Duster, appeared in his
junior yearbook picture in what seemed to be the same striped shirt
he had worn for his sophomore picture. As a senior, he was among a
handful of Sumter High's National Merit Scholar semi-finalists, but
he didn't appear in a group photo. In fact, he disappeared from the
yearbook altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry about not fitting in,'' said Grisham. ``He
figured, `I'm an outcast. Why should I participate?'''
</P>
<P>
   Back in his red brick home on Wren Street, a tree-lined suburban
road in the nicer part of town, there was also turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like his father,'' said Grisham. ``His dad was very
stern and strict.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Gladys, served more than 20 years as the church
secretary for St. James Lutheran Church. Mother and son remained
close when he moved away soon after high school. His father,
Truman, died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Barton was busted for breaking into a drugstore. At 20,
he did it again and got off with counseling, no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fancied himself a mastermind criminal,'' Grisham said. ``He
was always a schemer.''
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a chemistry degree from the University of South
Carolina, Barton moved through a string of jobs in the chemical
industry, building his confidence as he built his resume.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, his career path led him to Texarkana, a distinctly
unlovely city cut from the flat, piney woods of East Texas. He had
a good job that paid well, and he earned a promotion. He bought a
brand new house and joined a church. He and his wife had their
first child, a chubby blonde they named Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Under the veneer of normalcy, Barton's troubles were fermenting.
</P>
<P>
   At TLC Manufacturing Inc., where he started as a chemist in 1984
and became president two years later, Barton continually retreated
into his office, locking the door behind him, recalled LeeAnn
Burke, his secretary for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought people were out to get him,'' said Burke, who
remembers her old boss as ``paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton, she said, would surreptitiously tape telephone
conversations with other employees. He so disliked one salesman,
she said, that he would alter orders the salesman placed in the
company computer system to delay deliveries to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a quick temper,'' Burke said. ``When somebody got on
his bad side, you stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton's home life seemed just as volatile.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Debra, suffered a miscarriage, he belittled her
pain at work. When he talked about her with co-workers, he referred
to her by a demeaning nickname: ``Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real controlling,'' said Burke, who screened Barton's
telephone calls. ``She couldn't do anything without his permission.
She couldn't leave the house without telling him first where she
was going to go, and what she was going to do, and when she was
going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bartons rarely socialized, former neighbors said, spending
evenings alone in their brick ranch house on a dead-end street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the year after their son was born, the Bartons joined
First Baptist Church of Texarkana, a sprawling facility with a
theaterlike sanctuary on the outskirts of town. But in a church
with 3,000 members, they barely left a mark. The pastor, the Rev.
D. Terry Land, could remember nothing about Barton or his wife,
even after finding the couple's picture in an old church directory.
Mark, holding baby Matthew, was smiling. Debra was not.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his public smiles, his life was anything but happy.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about Barton's management abilities, TLC's board of
directors fired him Sept. 13, 1990. According to a Texarkana police
report, he walked out the door ``visibly angry and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   He would soon return.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, in an elaborate late-night caper, Barton
broke into the building through a loading dock door, police said.
Once inside, he moved a refrigerator in the break room, allowing
him to reach a window that he knew was never locked. He crawled
through the window to reach the executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   Barton downloaded financial data and the formulas to TLC's
products from two computers and erased the machines' hard drives.
On his way out, he grabbed two 3-inch-thick file folders that
contained similar information.
</P>
<P>
   Police and company officials immediately suspected Barton. When
he was questioned by police, he denied the crime but inadvertently
implicated himself. He told officers that anyone could have entered
through the loading dock door, even though they hadn't told him how
the crime was executed. Then, when his wife came into the room,
Barton told her, ``They think I stole the formulas.'' But the
officers hadn't told him the formulas had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was charged with felony burglary. But he was released a
few hours later, after the company declined to prosecute. Barton
had struck a deal with the company, according to police records,
but executives declined to comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   After he got out of jail, Barton returned home, put his wife and
child in his car and drove to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A CLOUD OF SUSPICION
</P>
<P>
   With no house, no job and no prospects, Barton still landed on
his feet in his Georgia exile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had a sales job with a chemical company, later, a
better job at another firm. The next year, the Bartons had a
daughter, Mychelle, and they bought a five-bedroom house in
Douglasville with plenty of space for their two children and two
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Barton gave the appearance of a happy father, devoted husband,
successful businessman. On Saturdays, he cooked bacon and pancakes
or waffles for his children. They would watch cartoons on
television and, if Debra wasn't home, Barton said later, ``run
through the house and beat each other with pillows and just get
totally out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, the facade crumbled. Not long after Mychelle's
birth, he testified in 1995, every time he traveled on business,
Debra suspected he was having affairs. She was right.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1993, Barton began dating newlywed Leigh Ann Lang, 21,
a receptionist at the Macon chemical company where he was a
salesman. That June, a friend of Leigh Ann's said, Barton told her
and another woman that he had never loved anyone like he loved
Leigh Ann. By October, he said, he would be ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann left her husband just before Labor Day _ the same
weekend Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Spivey, took a
trip to the Spivey family's cabin in Alabama, where they were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   From the time their bodies were found, Barton was the prime
suspect. His demeanor _ cool, dispassionate _ only made authorities
more determined to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   When an Alabama investigator drove him to the crime scene,
``there was nothing about him grieving over the loss of his wife,''
said Michael Hauptman, a former Barton attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And when investigators asked him whether he was having an affair
when his wife was killed, according to court documents, he lied _
twice.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually admitted to the affair, but that wasn't enough for
authorities to charge him with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he spent the rest of his life under a cloud of
suspicion. State social workers investigated an allegation that
Barton had molested his daughter, but sought no criminal charges.
Debra's family continually insisted in news interviews and to
police that he had killed his wife and mother-in-law. And Alabama
authorities remained on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the killings, Alabama crime investigator Danny
Smith visited Leigh Ann, warning her that Barton said he would
always need a ``young, sexy wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cease to fill those needs,'' Smith recalled warning
her, ``you know he's going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   MADNESS AND MURDER
</P>
<P>
   It was late October 1998 when Leigh Ann Barton got a call at her
Atlanta office, where she was a customer service trainer. A
despondent Mark Barton was on the line. He told his wife he had
nothing more to live for and that he was going to kill himself,
said Henry County homicide Detective Rene Swanson, the lead
investigator in the Barton family murders.
</P>
<P>
   But when Leigh Ann arrived at the family's house, things had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind,'' Barton told his wife. ``I've already killed the
cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, investigators said, is the charade that followed, when he
spent two days helping his 8-year-old daughter, Mychelle, look for
the missing pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what convinced Leigh Ann to finally leave him,'' said
Swanson, who interviewed Leigh Ann's close friend, Rhonda Lassiter,
and family members.
</P>
<P>
   By last November, Leigh Ann was alone at Bristol Green
Apartments in Stockbridge. She leased a two-bedroom apartment,
modestly furnishing it with a dining room table, a love seat and a
slew of pictures of her with Barton's children. At Christmas,
Barton told her he had lost all his money in day trading. ``I need
help,'' he said, according to Leigh Ann's sister.
</P>
<P>
   In one three-day binge, he'd lost $153,000, according to a
trading report from Momentum Securities in Atlanta, where his
shooting rampage began. His losses ultimately totaled $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   By July 4, 1999, he had convinced her that he and the children
had no place else to go. They soon joined her in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But the night of July 27, Barton slammed a claw hammer into his
wife's head as she slept and hid her body in a hallway closet.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Barton took his kids to get haircuts. That
night, using the same hammer, he struck Matthew and Mychelle as
they slept in their beds, then immersed each child in the bathtub
to make sure he and she were dead.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main
reasons for my demise,'' Barton said in the letter he left in the
apartment. ``I killed the children to exchange them for five
minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Barton placed the children in their beds, a stuffed animal
beside Mychelle, a computer game beside Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)``I don't plan to live very much longer. Just long
enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Tony Biello was the first officer to reach the bloody scene
at Momentum Securities. ``There were bodies everywhere,'' Biello
said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police of Barton's unflinching demeanor as he
slowly walked through two trading offices, blasting away his
victims at close range. It was in stark contrast from Barton's
customarily bright and social character. Loretta Jolly, one of the
women at the complex's cafeteria, said they had nicknamed him ``Big
Money,'' since he was always bragging about his stock profits as he
ordered cheeseburgers and chili.
</P>
<P>
   Traders at All-Tech and Momentum called him ``the Rocket'' for
his boisterous personality, and the firms often placed him in the
middle of other traders because of his infectious enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But when he finally crashed, Barton had murdered 12 people and
wounded 13 others. Fleeing from police in his green minivan, he was
cornered at a BP gas station in Acworth, and he shot himself in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Police searching the family's Stockbridge apartment saw that
Barton had tried to scrub the blood in the bathroom and bedroom
carpets with soap and water. Detectives also found a kitten,
meowing in hunger. ``Tigger'' is now with Leigh Ann's parents in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment refrigerator was stocked with food, especially
children's snacks: Star Wars Fruit Chews, Juicy Juice, Hi-C. A
child's Boy Scout uniform was on a bed. There were permission slips
for a Boy Scout field trip that Barton had organized to the USS
Yorktown in South Carolina for late August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they had was for the children,'' said detective
Swanson. ``You walked in there, and if it hadn't been for the fact
it was a murder scene, it just seemed like the most normal place in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BARTON EPILOGUE
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I?''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   In the red brick house where Barton grew up, the only survivor
of his twisted life has retreated from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, watches the television news
reports about the killings, but does not speak publicly about the
killings. When a reporter left a letter outside her house asking
for an interview, she responded with an immaculately type-written
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know how I feel?'' she wrote. ``There are not
words in my vocabulary to express my feelings, but Psalm 94:17 says
it all. `If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would soon have
dwelt in the abode of silence.'''
