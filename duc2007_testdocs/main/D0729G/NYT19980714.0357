   ANDREWS, N.C. _ The discovery of a pickup truck believed stolen
by Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has led federal
investigators to double their force here and hint that they could
be close to finding the fugitive who was last reported seen Jan.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that
the man who reported his truck stolen knew Rudolph and had seen him
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear to investigators was why the man waited at
least two days to report the pickup stolen, giving Rudolph time to
escape with another six months' worth of food, which he also
allegedly stole from the man.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said that does not mean that the man,
identified as George Nordmann, an elderly health food store
proprietor, was trying to help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph. ``What would
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force
investigating the Birmingham bombing and three Atlanta bombings,
``This is a witness of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann's 1977 blue Nissan pickup truck was recovered Monday
shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested
area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C. Investigators said Nordmann
told them the pickup truck was stolen from him Thursday, along with
a large amount of food.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were
found on the pickup. ``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we
may,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators indicated that they believe they are closer to
Rudolph than they have been since he was named in February as a
suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that
killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously
injured a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson declared, ``We
are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they may have missed Rudolph, a
31-year-old carpenter and experienced outdoorsman, by just hours
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF official said a federal agent had passed through the
area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found Monday and that
the truck was not there. ``It was not in the location where it was
found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million
reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said Rudolph, who moved as a teenager with his mother
and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is
believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard
and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has
reenergized the manhunt for Rudolph, who was last reported seen at
a video store in Murphy on Jan. 30. A few days later, a pickup
truck registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the
day of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near
Murphy. Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of
the forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters
here in Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup
truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at
1-888-ATF- BOMB. There's a million dollar reward for information
leading to Rudolph's capture.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudoloph
was alive and hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
They also believed he was acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that,'' Enderson said. ``The search has been
intensified significantly.'' The number of agents in western North
Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had
about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared
into the woods. ``He had stolen another six months worth, or at
least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are
approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was first approached as if it might be
boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County , N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain
near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks
that reach 4500 to 5000 feet into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foilage is so thick you can't see....you can't find
anything,'' Thompson said. ``I said all along he was here and he'll
be here until he's caught.''
