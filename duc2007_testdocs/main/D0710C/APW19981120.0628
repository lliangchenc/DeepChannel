	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean
island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with
spying on Cyprus for a foreign country and will go on trial next
month. A defense request for bail was turned down.
	   The two were also charged with the illegal possession of
wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other
to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus
and Israel.
	   The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged
during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of
Larnaca. Judge Tefkros Economou, after retiring to consider the
evidence against them, returned to the court to announce that their
trial will begin Dec. 8 as the prosecution requested.
	   Adjourning the proceedings for a second time to look into a
defense request for bail, Economou later decided that the two must
continue to be held by Cypriot authorities given the gravity of the
charges they faced.
	   Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides earlier said the Israeli
Embassy in Cyprus would keep the two men inside its premises in the
capital Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Larnaca, until
the trial begins. Hergov and Damary have been held in the Nisosia
Central Prisons since their arrest Nov. 6.
	   Prosecutor George Papaioannou objected to the bail request,
arguing that the two faced ``serious spying charges.''
	   The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of
Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in
the apartment the two men had rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an
Israeli head of state.
	   Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their
arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia
in two separate cars. Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they
were guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
	   Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the
courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
	   The spying charge states that the two men collected information
linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign
state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two
worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a
main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.
