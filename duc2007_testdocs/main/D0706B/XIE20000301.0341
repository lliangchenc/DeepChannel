<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases Annual Anti-drug Certification Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report says Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay were not
certified for cooperating but were granted a national interest
waiver while Afghanistan and Burma were denied certification
outright.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were not certified because they "have been
world headquarters for the heroin business" for several years, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a briefing at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"In Afghanistan, the opium harvest grew substantially, and the
Taliban's full complicity in the drug trade has extended to the
point where both the harvesting and trafficking of opium is taxed,
" Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The annual certification report has been attacked by the
countries listed in the report as the interference into their
domestic affairs. Latin American countries believe the U.S.
administration should focus on efforts in reducing the consumption
of drugs in the United States.
