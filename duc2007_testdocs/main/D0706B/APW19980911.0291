	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to
Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the
anniversary of the military government's takeover.
	   Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro is scheduled to
visit Myanmar, also known as Burma, from Sept. 15-18. It will be
his final trip to Thailand's western neighbor as he is scheduled to
retire this year.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. The current military government came to
power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide
democracy movement.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front asked Chuan in a letter
on Friday to urge the army chief to reschedule his trip.
	   ``Thailand is a democratic country and the military government
in Burma killed many people in 1988. Recently they have arrested
nearly a thousand members of opposition parties,'' said Aung Naing
Oo, chairman of the ABSDF.
	   He said Chetta's trip would create a negative image for the Thai
government and the Myanmar military would use the visit for
propaganda.
