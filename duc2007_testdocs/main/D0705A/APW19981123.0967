	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga
arrived here Monday for a four-day visit which he said was aimed at
getting a firsthand view of the peace process in Spain's Basque
region, news reports said.
	   Skirting questions as to the possibility of him mediating in
resolving the Basque problem, Cossiga told reporters he was ``here
as a friend'' and had been invited to the northern Spanish region
by the governing Basque Nationalist Party.
	   His visit comes as Spain and the three-province Basque region
enjoys its third month of peace following the Sept. 18 cease-fire
by the armed separatist group ETA.
	   On Monday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Cossiga
``could come and go'' in Spain as often as he likes but stressed
that no intermediaries were needed to resolve the Basque conflict,
the private Europa Press news agency said.
	   The Italian centrist leader praised center-right Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's decision to begin making contacts to sound out
ETA's long-term intentions before full negotiations take place.
	   Cossiga added that peace in the Basque region would help
consolidate the European Union.
	   During the visit, Cossiga is to hold talks with Basque
Nationalist Party leaders and visit the several political and
cultural sites. He did not rule out a meeting with representatives
of Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year campaign for
independence.
