<HEADLINE> More Americans Use Alternative Therapies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans who
are using alternative treatments such as herbal supplements,
massage therapy and megavitamins is increasing dramatically, said
the Washington Post Wednesday by quoting studies published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.

"It is the beginning of the beginning of acceptance of some
forms of 1998 alternative medicine into mainstream medicine in the
United States," said George Lundberg, editor of the JAMA.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 83 million American adults, more than four out of
10, used some form of alternative medical treatment last year,
said a new survey by a Harvard research team.
</P>
<P>
They said that visits to practitioners of alternative
therapies, from herbal medicines to "energy healing," have
increased 47 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In addition to herbal medicine and "energy healing," the
alternative therapies included in the survey were relaxation
techniques, massage therapy, chiropractic, spiritual healing,
megavitamins, self-help, imagery, homeopathy, hypnosis,
biofeedback, acupuncture, folk remedies and various diets.
</P>
<P>
Among the fastest growing therapies were herbal remedies,
massage, megavitamins, relaxation techniques and "spiritual
healing."
</P>
<P>
One study found that moxibustion, a traditional Chinese therapy
in which a herb, Artemisia vulgaris, was burned next to an
acupuncture point on the toe, proved safe and effective for
stimulating fetuses in the wombs of pregnant women to turn over
from a breech position to a head-first position, which is safer
for delivery.
</P>
<P>
However, some medical experts have expressed concern that
herbal products, which do not have to meet any official government
purity or manufacturing standards, may carry dangerous impurities.
