<HEADLINE> Public Interest in Alternative Medicine Grows in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Almost 70 percent of
Americans now turn to alternative forms of medicine to cure their
illness when regular medicine has failed, according to a recent
nationwide survey.
</P>
<P>
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted by the
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, found that 56
percent of those surveyed believe their health plans should cover
alternative care. They are also willing to pay for it in their
medical insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
The label "alternative medicine" covers a range of products and
treatment, some derived from centuries-old spiritual and healing
traditions of non-Western societies, others as new and high-tech
as pressurized oxygen chambers.
</P>
<P>
In common is that they all fall outside the list of "standard"
therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical
authorities.
</P>
<P>
While the Stanford survey reflected the growing acceptance of
alternative medicine in the United States, half the people who
seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine
for basic health care. On average, participants in the study made
four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
</P>
<P>
On average, the survey respondents said they would be willing
to spend an additional 15 U.S. dollars a month in health insurance
for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or
acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School
revealed that one in three Americans used non-traditional or
non-Western medicine, spending 14 billion dollars a year in
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Los Angeles Times report said that
alternative medicine is now an 18-billion-dollar industry edging
into the U.S. mainstream. Americans will spend 3.65 billion
dollars on herbal remedies this year, a 100 percent increase since
1994.
</P>
<P>
California takes the lead in this trend. Six major health
insurance firms in California alone decided this year to cover
acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
A medical center in Los Angeles opened its integrative medicine
program in May. And the Stanford University Medical Center opened
a similar patient-care program in April.
</P>
<P>
What attracts consumers, medical centers and insurance
companies is the hope that alternative medical practices may
provide health plans with a relatively low-cost feature.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, doctors say, there is a negative feeling toward
Western medicine's ability to deal with certain health problems,
particularly chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Western medicine has made considerably less progress against
lingering health problems such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis
and chronic pain.
