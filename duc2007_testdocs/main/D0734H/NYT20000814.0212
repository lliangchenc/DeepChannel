   AUTISTIC-ADULTS-MED _ Support services for people with autism --
children and adults alike -- fall far short of fulfilling their
needs today, says a new study.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased
behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside
their family homes, the researchers say.
</P>

   SHOES-MAGNETS-MED _ Florsheim says its magnet-laden shoes can
ease pain and make your legs and back less tired. But a California
consumer group is not just taking issue with these claims; it is
suing the company for touting them as remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Justice Center, a nonprofit consumer protection
group, filed the suit last week in Orange County and asks that
Florsheim stop advertising the MagneForce shoes as a health aid and
refund the purchase price (about $122 plus tax) to people who
bought the shoes.

   COCAINE-ACUPUNCTURE-MED _ Cocaine addicts looking to get clean
may want to turn to needles for help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is
an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the
ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine,
experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study
from a major American medical school. A report on the finding
appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTIPATION-HISTORY-MED _ Here's a history topic you don't see
with much regularity: constipation. That's right, to the annals of
medical history comes the complete archival guide to the most basic
of bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   And why not, says James Whorton, author of ``Inner Hygiene,''
just published by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``For centuries, there has been a strong intuitive feeling that
regularity is essential for health, and because constipation is a
topic that affects just about all of us at one time or another,
it's always received a lot of attention,'' says Whorton, a
professor of medical history at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   BRAIN-OSTEOARTHRITIS-MED _ In their efforts to better understand
the nature of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis, researchers are
setting their sights a bit higher -- on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the soft and bony
tissues, is the most common type of arthritis, affecting
weight-bearing joints that include the knee and hip.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is unique, doctors say, because it can be so prolonged
and difficult to manage.
