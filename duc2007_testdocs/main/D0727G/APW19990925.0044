<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have  
subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a 
woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Callista Bisek, a staff member of the House Agriculture  
Committee, is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition Wednesday 
in the Gingriches' divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich. The  
couple married 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich  
gave Ms. Bisek funds or spent the couple's money on her. Earlier 
this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to 
temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to  
January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker. Those 
include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between 
Ms. Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone 
records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; 
photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video 
recordings of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requests any clothes or other personal items  
belonging to Gingrich that Ms. Bisek has in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither attorney in the case was available for comment Friday,  
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in today's editions.
