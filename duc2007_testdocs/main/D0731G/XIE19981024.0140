<HEADLINE> Maryland Grand Jury Subpoenas Linda Tripp's Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A Maryland grand jury
investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday,
demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Joe Murtha said he would fight the subpoena issued in the
Howard County, Maryland, grand jury inquiry being conducted by
Maryland prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli. He is examining whether
Tripp broke the state wiretapping law.
</P>
<P>
Montanarelli does not have any tapes that Tripp made. They are
in the custody of Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
In order to build a wiretapping case, Montanarelli would need
to pursue gaining custody of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
"This is an invasion of the attorney-client privilege and we're
going to fight this all the way," The Associated Press quoted
Murtha as saying.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena demands that Murtha appear before the grand jury
and produce originals or copies of any tapes containing the voice
of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Tripp's other lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said, "This is
another attempt by the prosecutor in Maryland to intimidate Linda
Tripp and her lawyers and this latest step is further evidence of
the political persecution of our client."
</P>
<P>
Tripp also is under scrutiny by Starr. He is investigating
whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes
which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction
in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
</P>
<P>
Zaccagnini said his client is still cooperating with Starr, as
she has been since last January 12, but that cooperation would end
immediately if Starr's office targets Tripp.
