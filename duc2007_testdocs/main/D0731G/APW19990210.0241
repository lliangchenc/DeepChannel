<HEADLINE> Senator Questions Starr's Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr came under  
increased criticism Wednesday as a Democratic senator questioned 
his conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also has advised Starr it intends to  
investigate the actions of Starr's office, including the Jan. 16, 
1998 offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her 
not discussing it with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible area of inquiry: Starr's failure to inform the  
department that he and others on his staff had contact with lawyers 
working on Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have suggested a possible conflict and  
misrepresentation when Starr's prosecutors told the Justice 
Department they hadn't had any contact with Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
Those comments by Starr's prosecutors are memorialized in notes 
taken by participants at a meeting in January 1998 at the Justice 
Department, when Attorney General Janet Reno was trying to decide 
whether Starr's office should handle the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard a lot about the rule of law recently'' in the  
impeachment trial, said Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. ``How does'' 
the rule of law ``apply to Ken Starr and the Office of Independent 
Counsel? Honesty and truthfulness and the rule of law also applies 
to those who are cloaked with the authority and the responsibility 
of enforcing those laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One area that may be of concern to the Justice Department is the  
contact between Paul Rosenzweig, who is a member of Starr's office, 
and Philadelphia lawyer Jerome Marcus, who assisted Mrs. Jones' 
legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days before Linda Tripp's first contact with Starr's office  
on Jan. 12, 1998, Marcus spoke with Rosenzweig about the Lewinsky 
allegations, a contact that Starr confirmed in his testimony Nov. 
19 to the House Judiciary Committee. Starr said his office did not 
act on it that he did not believe the information on Jan. 8, 1998 
included any mention of Linda Tripp's name. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, The New York Times has reported that there were  
several conversations between Marcus and Rosenzweig from November 
1997 to January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are questions about the contact between Starr law  
partner Richard Porter and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Tripp was looking for a new attorney, Goldberg called  
Porter on Mrs. Tripp's behalf. The question is whether, through his 
contact with Goldberg, Porter ended up representing anyone, 
including Mrs. Tripp, involved in the case who went to the 
prosecutor's office. Depending on precisely what Porter did, Starr 
could have been barred from taking on the Lewinsky probe because of 
a conflict-of-interest provision in the law governing appointment 
of independent counsels.
