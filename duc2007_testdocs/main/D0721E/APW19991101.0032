	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A judge today barred defense lawyers from  
using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused 
of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Barton Voigt told lawyers for Aaron  
McKinney that the strategy was, in effect, a temporary insanity or 
a diminished capacity defense, both of which are prohibited under 
Wyoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Afton N. Timothy, McKinney's stepsister, testified that she  
learned of the beating from McKinney's then-girlfriend, Kristen 
Price, who said he and an accomplice planned to pose as homosexuals 
and rob Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
		   McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death last year. The 
21-year-old University of Wyoming political science major suffered 
at least 18 blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney and Russell Henderson, 22, posed as  
homosexuals, lured Shepard out of a downtown bar, drove him to a 
remote fence, tied him to it and pistol-whipped him into a coma. 
Police said robbery was the main motive but that Shepard may also 
have been singled out because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	During opening statements, the defense told jurors that the  
crime was triggered by a combination of McKinney's drug and alcohol 
use, traumatic youthful homosexual episodes and an unwanted sexual 
advance by Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	They had hope to borrow a page from what is informally called a  
``gay panic'' defense, built on a theory that a person with latent 
gay tendencies will have an uncontrollable, violent reaction when 
propositioned by a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give  
others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	And the judge said today that he did not believe defense  
attorneys had offered any evidence that such a strategy would be 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if relevant, the evidence will mislead and confuse the  
jury,'' he stated in a written order released before the trial 
resumed today. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney could receive the death penalty if convicted. Henderson  
received two life sentences after pleading guilty in April to 
felony murder and kidnapping.
