   NEW YORK _ For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration
Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their
first political rally. For some older protesters, though, the march
_ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in
Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so
often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response
was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the
loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard
has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the
country as has no other single event in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the
Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000
people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic. Confrontations with
police officers resulted in 120 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   While the size of the protest in midtown surprised even its
organizers, the evocation of anger and sadness on the streets of
New York was hardly unique. Candlelight vigils have taken place
across the country, from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo.,
Raleigh, N.C., and Lubbock, Texas. In San Francisco, the giant
rainbow flag in the Castro district that symbolizes the gay rights
movement was lowered to half staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been filled with discussion of the crime,
students have rallied on college campuses, vigils have been held at
churches.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even
as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever
before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the
not-so distant past. Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase
in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had
unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call
complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.
</P>
<P>
   Recent protests over issues like benefits for domestic partners
and the right to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade have lacked
the drama of the guerrilla street tactics of AIDS activists. Some
gay men and lesbians contend that their success in drawing
attention to AIDS gave some a false feeling of security and
acceptance, especially in the city with the largest gay population
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense, I think, in the gay community, particularly
living in a certain segment of it in New York City, that we can
live in a kind of bubble and feel relatively safe and feel as if
we've arrived,'' said Tim Allis, 37, a magazine editor. ``A sense
that gay rights are there, that we are so much a part of the
mainstream in so many ways, so visible, with so many role models on
television. It's a bit of an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ruble, 45, had been to two gay pride rallies and parades,
but never to a large protest march until Monday night. ``Sometimes,
in our little gay lives in the middle of America, I think we have
forgotten that they kill us,'' he said. ``They hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 20 interviews with gay men and lesbians in the past
week, many people said that the killing of Matthew Shepard had
struck a strong emotional chord. Some cited his clean-cut image.
Others spoke of the brutality of the crime, in which he was left,
severely beaten, lashed to a fence in near-freezing temperatures to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Blotcher, who was a spokesman for Queer Nation, a street
protest group, in the early 1990s, said that in recent years, his
group and other militant organizations had run out of steam and
were failing to attract young members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking to younger people to pick up the mantle and it
wasn't really happening,'' he said. ``I attributed that to that
fact that a new generation came of age and said: `I don't have to
be a gay activist, I'm just a gay person. It doesn't have to be an
issue.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something like this reminds us that it still is an
issue,'' he added. ``There were lots of young people at the rally
on Fifth Avenue. And there were people I know there who had hung up
their activist mantles and gone into semiretirements.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, there were 82 anti-gay bias crimes reported
this year through Oct. 4, compared with 46 during the same period
last year, representing a 78 percent jump, said Deputy Inspector
Barbara Sicilia, commander of the Bias Unit. Overall bias crimes
rose by 2 percent, to 384 from 374.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan,
where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in the
boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Locke, director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian
Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims
of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city
shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible
outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in
Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gay-related crimes have people come to your neighborhood
and seek you out to hurt you,'' he said. ``Now people don't have to
come downtown. As we are more visible outside of Manhattan, we have
also seen an increase in crimes in those neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the
rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by. The
National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data
from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent
crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in
1997, the last year for which statistics are available. In 1996,
the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local
organizations, which often use different standards from police when
determining motivation. Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and
criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and an author of
``Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed'' (Plenum
Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck
the trends of other bias crimes.

<P>
   ``Most hate crimes respond to economic factors like the
unemployment rate, but not gay-bashing,'' he said. ``Gay-bashing
has nothing to do with money, with economic survival. That's why so
many perpetrators are teen-agers and come from every point among
the economic continuum. It is typically done by young people, with
their hormones raging, feeling confusion about sexual identity.
Young guys in denial about their own homosexual feelings who see
the very presence of a gay person as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration Monday night was billed as a ``political
funeral'' for Shepard. But organizers also saw it as an opportunity
to protest the rise in anti-gay crimes in New York City and to call
on the state Senate to pass an anti-bias law for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation
that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes. In these states,
someone who assaults a gay man or a lesbian can be convicted of
assault, but not a bias-related assault. New York does have a law,
aggravated harassment in the first degree, that outlaws harassing
people because of ``the race, color, religion or national origin of
such person,'' but it makes no reference to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Allis, the magazine editor, said that Shepard's killing put
recent history into a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was that sense of connecting the dots,'' he said.
``Between the well-publicized murders, the less-publicized hate
crimes that we hear about across the country, Trent Lott's words
calling homosexuality a disease, and small acts of intolerance,
there were all sorts of indications. But the murder of Matthew
Shepard brought the picture into relief.''
