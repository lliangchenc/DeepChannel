   IZMIT, Turkey _ From the streets to government offices,
earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded
with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead
and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of
thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are overwhelmed and now they are completely concerned
with the total number of dead,'' said Richard Van Hazebrouck, a UN
humanitarian aid coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not thinking of the next step, but we are putting
pressure to get some figures of what the Turkish authorities need
for the survivors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo planes from all over the world have brought in medical
supplies, blankets, plastic sheeting and even field hospitals to
help the living after Tuesday's 7.4 magnitude quake, which
authorities say could be the world's deadliest in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But international relief workers are worried that this is not
enough to care for the hundreds of thousands of people who will
never be able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any more rescue teams on site. Now we must move
into the second stage, which is looking after the survivors,'' said
Hazebrouck.
</P>
<P>
   With water pipes broken and electric lines down over a huge
swath of Turkey's northeast, relief workers are also concerned
about the possible spread of disease, especially with the thousands
of corpses rotting under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   An epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta flew into Turkey Friday to help assess health needs, along
with two US water sanitation experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be sure, especially with this sweltering weather,
that you're not looking at an outbreak of contagious diseases,''
said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator of the US Agency for
International Development's humanitarian relief department.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, dressed in black, echoed Parmer's
concern. ``Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of
epidemic,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign engineers and architects are expected to arrive in
Turkey over the next few days to help officials decide which
buildings must be knocked down because of heavy damage and which
can remain standing.
</P>
<P>
   Many still-standing buildings in the hard-hit Izmit and Yalova
areas are clearly unsafe, lurching down at one end or leaning
dangerously out into the street. Five aftershocks, ranging between
4.3 and 4.6 on the Richter scale, rocked the disaster zone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many people are living out in the open, along the side
of roads and in parks in the city center. Families string up sheets
and blankets for privacy, the few possessions they managed to save
carefully arranged in the only place they can now call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People must understand that there is an urgent need for
portable toilets, cleaning materials, garbage collection - the
local authorities are not able to cope with the scale of these
things,'' said Karen Lever, an International Red Cross logistical
worker in the makeshift tent hospital located in Yalova's football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke outside a tent in which staffers were preparing for an
expected upsurge of infectious diseases. ``The water will be a
problem _ clean water. And sewage and disposing of bodies with all
these people outside in (95-degree) heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of those who did manage to get out alive after the
45-second quake that destroyed so much, the only issue was whether
more people could be pulled from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, large swaths of Izmit were forbidden to rescue
workers while firefighters battled a blaze at the nation's biggest
petroleum refinery. The ruins of the shattered houses there now
conceal an unknown number of dead, and, perhaps, injured.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign search and rescue teams managed to find at least three
people Friday, raising hopes that others may have survived
underneath the collapsed buildings, despite the heat and the lack
of water.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-member American team that arrived on Wednesday in Izmit has
been scouring the crumbled building remains one by one, with German
Shepherds trained to sniff any smell of life. Saturday another team
of about 90 people will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But on the wreckage of what was once a six-story apartment
building, the yellow-helmeted rescue workers could do little for
the relatives of a young woman and her father, whose weak shouts
had been heard until about mid afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a sound, any sound!'' shouted the aid team's Turkish
translator, kneeling over a small hole between two huge slabs of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``With whatever strength you still have scream, please scream,
scream!'' she cried, while a sensitive microphone was dangled into
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes one of the rescue workers turned toward the
dozens of anxious Turks who were waiting across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This machine will pick up anything, heartbeats, breathing, and
there's no real indication that there's anything down there _ we're
not going to stay here,'' Daniel Bickham announced to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the pleas of a young Turkish soldier _ who had heard some
sounds just a few hours earlier _ convinced the team to give it one
more try. Two hours later, the rescue workers finally walked away,
leaving behind the anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue
workers were certain were two corpses buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same scene on Yalova's Stadium Street, now devoid of
the apartment buildings where hundreds of families had lived before
3:04 a.m. Tuesday. For 10 minues, French rescue workers and Turkish
volunteers stopped working to huddle together in total silence,
straining to hear anything from their delicate microphones. After a
few minutes, they stood back from the rubble, their heads shaking.
</P>
<P>
   On one street in Izmit, not even the rumble of bulldozers
ripping through concrete and crushed furniture could convince
26-year-old Ilkay Yildiz that his 20-year-old fiance with the long
brown hair and quick smile was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Every day since the quake he has been waiting at the edge of the
rubble for Hacer Subasi to appear. Even after the foreign rescue
team left a day earlier _ convinced that there was nobody left to
save _ and the bulldozer started digging for corpses, Yildiz
refuses to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the most beautiful, wonderful girl in the world and she
cannot be dead,'' he murmured, falling to the ground and beginning
to cry.
