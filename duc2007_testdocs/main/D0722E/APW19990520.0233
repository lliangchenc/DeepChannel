<HEADLINE> House Approves Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation approved Thursday by the House and  
sent to the White House would commit the United States to an 
anti-missile national defense system. President Clinton was 
expected to sign the measure, which the Senate modified to meet 
administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of  
the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, 
an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against 
limited ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia  
on arms reductions. Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. 
missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000  
on firm plans for an anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995. He also opposed an  
earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear 
that the defense system would be limited and focused against 
threats from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the  
House agreed to the revised version Thursday, despite some 
reluctance by supporters of the original House plan 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with the legislation,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,  
R-Pa., chief sponsor of the House version. The changes, he said 
``are simply cover for liberal Democrats who don't support missile 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House  
Armed Services Committee, said it should be clear that when the 
president signs the bill he is changing U.S. policy and committing 
the nation to a national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of ballistic missile attack is real, and it is here  
today,'' Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic  
defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 
2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system 
can be build. ``We ought to be very sober about any of these 
exhortations ... from people who want to wish this into 
existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has budgeted $10.5 billion between 1999 and  
2005 to develop a limited national missile defense system. It 
became more positive toward eventual deployment of such a system 
after North Korea last year tested missiles that flew over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a  
scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense 
Initiative, or ``Star Wars'' program, proposed by President Reagan 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the  
former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to 
stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state. It would not 
be space-based.
