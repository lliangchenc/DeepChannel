<HEADLINE> URGENT: U.S. Missile Fails to Hit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. prototype missile
interceptor streaked into space on Saturday morning in search of a
mock warhead launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California
State, but failed to hit the target, the U.S. Defense Department
said.
</P>
<P>
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's dive to
develop a National Missile Defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor missile was launched from a U.S. Army missile
range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes
after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
