	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 400 Indians blocked Venezuela's
main highway to Brazil with huge logs to protest a high-voltage
power line being built in the ``Lost World'' of Amazon rain
forests.
	   The Indians shut down the El Dorado-Santa Elena International
Highway near the gold mining town of El Dorado, about 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Caracas, on Monday and Tuesday,
said Nicolas Betis of the Bolivar State Indian Federation. They
might carry out the action again Friday.
	   Construction of the (dlrs) 110 million, 500-kilometer (300-mile)
power line is deforesting swaths of jungle and destroying Indian
yuca, corn, banana, sugar and pineapple crops, he said.
	   The project is affecting about 15,000 people in 30 communities
of Pemon, Karina, Akawaio and Arawako Indians.
	   ``The deforestation is just horrible,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin,
vice president of the Venezuela branch of the Audubon Society, who
was at the protest site.
	   Some of the logs the Indians rolled onto the highway were nearly
as wide as she is tall, she said.
	   One-third of the power line is to run through the 3-million
hectare (7.4 million-acre) Canaima National Park, a popular tourist
destination. It is home to Angel Falls, which at 978 meters (3,208
feet) is the world's longest cascade, and to the eerily beautiful,
flat-topped mountains that were the inspiration for Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World.''
	   Government officials say the power line is to run mainly
alongside highways already built in the region and will cause
little environmental damage.
	   The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities
in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to
Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin
America.
	   Environmentalists say the companies will increase damage to the
forests.
	   The Indians say much of the land where the power line is going
up belongs to them and they were never consulted.
