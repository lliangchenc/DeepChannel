   LONDON _ The British government said Wednesday that it would
continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the
author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets
the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to achieve a resolution to the problem that is
going to be acceptable to both sides,'' said a spokesman for the
Foreign Office. ``We've always taken the opportunity to press for
assurances of Salman Rushdie's safety, and that is what Robin Cook
will be doing when he meets Kamal Kharazi tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening
of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York
that ``we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain has always insisted that nothing short of a complete
lifting of the death sentence, as well as the revocation of the
$2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head pledged by a revolutionary
foundation in Tehran, would be an acceptable solution.
</P>
<P>
   After he wrote the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Rushdie was
accused of blasphemy against Islam and condemned to death in a
religious decree by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. Since
then, he has lived in safe houses around London, guarded around the
clock by British agents.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie and several representatives from the International
Rushdie Defense Committee met with members of the Foreign Office on
Wednesday and the committee issued a statement saying that it
remained ``cautiously optimistic'' about Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iranian government has said in the past that it
would not actively encourage anyone to kill Rushdie, it has never
explicitly revoked the death sentence, nor canceled the bounty.
