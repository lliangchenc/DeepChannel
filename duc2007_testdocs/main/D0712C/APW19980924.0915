	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that
his government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward
for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, paving the way for
upgrading strained ties with the United Kingdom.

which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''
Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart,
Robin Cook.
