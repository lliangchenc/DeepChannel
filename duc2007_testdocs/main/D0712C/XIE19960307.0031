<HEADLINE> Iran to Take Rushdie Case to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today that
it will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like
the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference here that Iran will ask the United
Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious
sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We think there is room for such an action at different
international forums including the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter to an international corps of
reporters here to report on March 8th parliamentary elections,
he stressed that the concept of freedom in the West led to
violations of the rights of others.
</P>
<P>
While answering the question by Xinhua, Mirsalim said "Iran is
planning to take the issue of insulting religious sanctities,
which has resulted in the Rushdie issue, to the international
bodies, including to the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there is a deviation inherent in the concept
of freedom in some of the Western societies that tramples the
rights of the most people in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the cultural community and the authors in the West
had been committed to respecting the religious beliefs of the
people, a problem such as Salman Rushdie would have never
emerged," he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry was committed to defend Islamic
culture and rejected allegations by critics that his ministry
took sides with the religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"Being neutral does not mean anything. We have to defend
the Islamic culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran
intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa
against Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said during his
recent trip to central Asian states that Iran will resume talks
with the European Union (EU) on the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on
British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest
against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and
exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Liberal weekly Bahman reported in February that former deputy
guidance minister, Ahmad Masjed Jame'ie, resigned over differences
pertaining the new restrictions imposed on authors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance came under
heavy attacks in 1995 by the religious conservatives that took
the ministry for allowing the publication of romantic novels.
</P>
<P>
In a sudden about-face in its publication policy, the
ministry declared that authors have to receive permission prior
to publication of their books.
