<HEADLINE> Europeans Set off in Round-the-World Balloon Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Europeans set off
Wednesday from Switzerland in the latest quest to circle the world
non-stop in a balloon, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten
from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain,
departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard
Breitling Orbiter II.
</P>
<P>
Their 53-meter-high combined helium and hot-air balloon slowly
lifted off at 9:55 a.m. (0855 GMT) in cold, calm air with 5,000
spectators on hand to wish it a safe journey.
</P>
<P>
It briefly descended, but rose again when the crew dropped
ballast from their bright orange pressurized basket.
</P>
<P>
The balloonists' plan was to soar quickly to nearly 8,000
meters and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle
East on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Brietling Orbiter II is scheduled to complete its
globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
