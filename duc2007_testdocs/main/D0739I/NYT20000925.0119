   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Is there life after ``Seinfeld''?
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers, surveying the mostly feeble comedies that remain
since Jerry and the gang left prime time in 1998, may have glumly
concluded that no, there is not. But is there life after
``Seinfeld'' for the show's cast? Michael Richards is about to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who
was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door
when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman
the mailman. Kramer became a cult figure on one of the most
successful sitcoms of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features
and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct. 24 on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7). He
will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who
specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an
American Inspector Clouseau.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of
being typecast. He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention''
that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation. ``They
didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept. Now, are you
going to have your hair up? How are you going to come through the
door?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Richards is entirely leaving ``Seinfeld'' _ or Seinfeld
_ behind. For one thing, the team that assembled his new show
consists of three former ``Seinfeld'' writers, including Spike
Feresten, author of the legendary ``Soup Nazi'' episode. For
another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on
building a better sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,''
said Richards. ``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said,
`Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off.'' Because
Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the
series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the ``logistics'' of
the former role.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to
accept Richards in a non-Kramer role. Co-creator Gregg Kavet
touched on the conundrum the ``Michael Richards'' team faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with Kramer, probably one of the best-loved
characters ever on television,'' said Kavet. ``And it's something
where everyone is expecting to see that, but they're also reluctant
to see the exact same thing again. So what we've tried to do is
basically figure out ways to exploit Michael's strengths, . . .
continue to use things like physical comedy and the disguises,
certain characteristics that came up with Kramer, without having
the same type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards. The
actor's speaking style is deliberate, even ponderous, a far cry
from Kramer's extraterrestrial outbursts. Richards referred to
himself several times as an ``artist,'' and lapsed frequently into
performers' jargon. But his love of his craft, especially physical
comedy, comes through when he discusses some of his comic heroes,
the likes of Ernie Kovacs, Peter Sellers, Charles Chaplin, and
Jacques Tati.
</P>
<P>
   By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The
Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because
NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show
relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of
the show. The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the
supporting cast around Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.
</P>
<P>
   He did emphasize, though, his hopes that the show will develop
the kind of ensemble strength that became a hallmark of
``Seinfeld.'' Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night
Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were
added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with
a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like it's all hinged on me,'' said Richards. ``I
have a driving style, and certainly (some of the) capers will
circulate around the character that I'll be playing. But I feel
that this is going to be an ensemble-driven show.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Richards and Meadow are the professional comedians and
Devane is known for a glowering intensity in film and TV dramas, it
was Devane who showed a deadpan, even Seinfeldian, touch when he
explained how he got his role. ``They were looking for an older
guy, and I'm an older guy,'' he said dryly. ``So that all kind of
worked out.''
