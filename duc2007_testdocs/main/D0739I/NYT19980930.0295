   Depressed that there's no more ``Seinfeld?'' Don't fret: An
herbal medicine man is offering free Saint Johnswort to help
addicts through the depression he expects to come with
Seinfeld-less Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kits'' include a month's supply of Saint
Johnswort and a list of 25 names that rhyme with female body parts.
The kits have been created as ``a contribution to the improvement
of society as a whole,'' says Ken Hakuta, creator and CEO of
AllHerb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``the show about nothing'' can feel as good as they did
when Seinfeld was on the air, and it's all free, Hakuta says.
</P>
<P>
   His new Web site, AllHerb.com, is being launched to offer
consumers a comprehensive herbal education, he says. Industry
experts will offer health tips, news and feature articles, as well
as a mail-order supply of many herbal products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun way to show the application of natural herbal
supplements,'' Hakuta says of the Seinfeld kits. ``What we are
demonstrating here is that natural products can have very positive
influence on our moods and our health. Herbs help us feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can leave an e-mail message saying absolutely nothing on
AllHerb.com's Seinfeld message board; they can also send absolutely
nothing (except a clear return address) via regular mail to
``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kit,'' Jericho Communications, 304 Hudson
St., Suite 700, New York, NY 10013. Delivery will take a couple of
weeks, a company spokeswoman says.
</P>
<P>
   The kit, when taken in combination with any of the non-Seinfeld
situation comedies in the new fall lineup, is intended to induce
about the same level of enjoyment and happiness that we all
received from Jerry and friends for the past decade, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: The kit should not be taken with an empty remote
control ... or without the consent of your doctor.
