<HEADLINE> New NBC Show Not a Kramer Copy  </HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there
was life after Kramer. Acting life, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former
''Seinfeld'' star said. ''There wasn't anything that was really
exciting me. So I thought I was going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about
nothing,'' Richards took it easy. He traveled, restored his home,
read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little
acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David
Copperfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards
Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los
Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to
realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.
