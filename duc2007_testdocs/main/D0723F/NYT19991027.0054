ANALYSIS: FEINSTEIN SUDDENLY FACES A FIGHT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep. Tom Campbell's entry
Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed
the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's experience, fund-raising ability and moderate
positions instantly make him the front-runner in a crowded field of
largely unknown GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein must now engage in a far more aggressive campaign,
while Democratic Party leaders no longer will be able to ignore the
California contest in favor of headline grabbers such as Hillary
Rodham Clinton's quest for a New York Senate seat. And the sudden
intensity diminishes the likelihood that Feinstein will be named to
the Democratic ticket as either Al Gore or Bill Bradley's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Campbell has won elections,'' said Jim Jordan, political
director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. ``He's a
serious person and not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other
politician at her level, must now gird for another tough contest,
her fourth statewide battle of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell is a much smarter, more experienced and much more
adroit candidate'' than Feinstein's previous Senate opponents, said
Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who served as former Gov. Pete
Wilson's communications director. ``This will be her toughest race
since she lost to Pete Wilson (in 1990).''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Campbell entered the race, Feinstein's camp
maintained that they took nothing for granted. However, none of the
other candidates _ Ron Unz, Ray Haynes, Bill Horn or J.P. Gough _
has Campbell's electoral advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best candidate that Republicans have in the field,''
said Jennifer Duffy, an editor for the Cook Report, a nonpartisan
political newsletter that handicaps congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may not have to run a marathon,'' Duffy said of
Feinstein's race for re-election, ``but she's going to break a
sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Stanford Law professor who is regarded by colleagues
as perhaps the most cerebral member of Congress, said he will base
his Senate run on the intellectual notion of individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a person should have a personal life as free from
government intrusion as possible,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   It is from that belief that Campbell says he draws his support
for legal abortions, as well as his opposition to a personal income
tax (which he says should be replaced by a national sales tax).
</P>
<P>
   It will be a tough sell in a contest against a woman
whom &LR; Campbell has so far refused to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Feinstein has been a good senator,'' Campbell said
Tuesday. ``I believe I could be a better senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his moderation will be an asset in the contest with
Feinstein, he must first convince conservative Republican primary
voters that he is their best choice. At a news conference last
night in Washington, Campbell said no less than five times that he
was a ``fiscal conservative,'' touting his support of small
government and less taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as fiscally conservative as anyone in the field,''
Campbell said, ``and I'm someone who's got a chance to actually
win.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how eloquent Campbell gets &LR; may be on the stump, the
case against Feinstein will be hard to make. She is a respected
political moderate, as Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong _ who
lost to Barbara Boxer last year _ seemed to concede when he
repeatedly commended Feinstein in his stump speech, declaring that
Boxer ``is no Dianne Feinstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is their opponent, Republicans have begun to
portray Feinstein as less accommodating, insisting the crowning
achievements of her Senate career _ the creation of a new national
park in the Mojave Desert and the enactment of a ban on assault
weapons _ are not so popular in the burgeoning suburbs and inland
cities far from the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer was far left, and Dianne Feinstein is moderate
left,'' said Fong, who is now a state co-chair of George W. Bush's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fong said Feinstein's GOP opponent in 1995, former Rep. Michael
Huffington, ``who was not exactly a first-tier candidate, showed
that Dianne Feinstein is vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what Huffington had in ample supply was money,
pumping $29 million of his own resources into the campaign. Fong,
who has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP race, said the best
candidate will be ``whomever can raise the most money.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are counting on the strong coattails of the GOP
presidential nominee to help whomever runs against Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate is going to be significantly better for
Tom Campbell in 2000 than it was for Matt Fong running in 1998,''
said Steve Schmidt, who was Fong's communication director.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will go after Feinstein for her strong political
connections to China _ she is on close terms with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin _ as well as her husband's business ties to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that we're looking into accusations of
Chinese spying, she's having dinner with Jiang Zemin,'' said Stuart
DeVeaux, a spokesman for the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the potential lines of attack, Feinstein enjoys a
broad base of support. A Field Poll released last week showed her
favorable ratings well above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feinstein has demonstrated she can be an independent voice for
the people of California,'' said her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata,
in what is likely to emerge as a campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's announcement puzzled many observers _ and not only
because it was made after sunset from the Republican Party
headquarters on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Why leave a safe House seat to take on an incumbent with great
poll numbers, proven fund-raising ability and a strong bipartisan
reputation?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say Campbell has grown increasingly
frustrated in the House, where he has always been treated as an
outsider. Campbell has consistently voted against his GOP
colleagues on matters ranging from abortion to gun control, and he
was one of only seven Republicans to vote against Newt Gingrich's
bid to be re-elected as speaker in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with pressure from Stanford University to choose
between a career in politics or academia, pushed Campbell into
making the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates it in the House,'' said a Democratic member who asked
not to be identified. ``I think he believes he has nothing to
lose.''
