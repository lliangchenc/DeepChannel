<HEADLINE> 12,000 Commit Suicide Each Year in France </HEADLINE>

PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 people have committed
suicide each year in France since 1993, said the official National
Institute of Demographical Studies (INED) today.
</P>
<P>
With a suicide rate close to 20 for 100,000 residents in the
country, France is ranged the fourth among the Western countries
with the highest rates of suicides, after Finland, Denmark, and
Austria, said the INED.
</P>
<P>
The major causes for suicides in France are economic crisis,
unemployment, isolation as well as a decrease of the number of
religious services and practices, said the INED.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 12,500 people committed suicide in France as compared
with 8,300 in 1975 and an average of 6,000 in the 1950s, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the age groups that are most
vulnerable to suicide are those of younger people, as the number
of suicides increased by 3.5 times among the people from 25 to 34
years old and by three times among those from 20 to 24 years old
between 1950 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths resulting from suicides in France has now
surpassed that of traffic accidents, also one of the highest among
Western countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The INED report was published on the National Day Against
Suicide, which was first held last year.
