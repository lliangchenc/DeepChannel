EDITORIAL: IRAN'S MISSILE TEST

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   Iran's test of a missile that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey is a disturbing and dangerous development. Testing such an
advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying
biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to
targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense
Middle East. It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite
the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami,
is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from
developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic conservatives strongly opposed to President Khatami's
foreign and domestic policies still wield paramount power in Iran.
That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption
and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important
Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most
influential pro-Khatami newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must now try to divine what the missile test reveals
about the power struggle in Iran and the ability of President
Khatami to produce more moderate foreign policies. The Clinton
administration's efforts to renew a dialogue with Iran should be
pursued, but they must also be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also needs to initiate wider diplomatic
efforts to curtail outside aid to Iranian missile programs. The
missile tested Wednesday is based on a design imported from North
Korea. But Russia and China have also repeatedly exported sensitive
missile technology to Iran. Washington should demand that Russia
and China tighten their export controls and punish violators. It
should also press North Korea to end rogue missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration ought to devote some attention to reassuring
Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy and feels
newly vulnerable. Syria already has missiles capable of reaching
Israel; Iraqi Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Iran may
soon pose a missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate dangers facing Israel, however, have not
substantially increased, and Israel should not act precipitously.
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at
least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear
weapons. That allows some time for arms control and diplomacy.
Israel can also improve its regional security by pursuing efforts
to negotiate peace with the Palestinians. Iran's missile test is a
warning of future danger that should not be ignored.
