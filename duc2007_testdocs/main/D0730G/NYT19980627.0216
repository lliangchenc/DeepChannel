   UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the
Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be
crocodile tears. As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even
its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved
in tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato
Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes
at $2 billion over five years. Given that federal spending will be
about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a
rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things. It
wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage
of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of
how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in
tax revenues. The magnitude of federal spending is so large that
average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a
practical way.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has
been mostly from pork appropriations. This makes the political
calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition. On the one
hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most
cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess. On the
other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it. This is
why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and
reward allies.
</P>
<P>
   Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the
item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument
to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto. The
bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about
``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance,
which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this
particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess
contempt for it. Although the line-item veto was a priority in the
GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has
waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of residual support will become more evident when
congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to
change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional. The
response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a
luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of
pork take? Moore lists a few worth pondering. This year's budget,
for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to
enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National
Center for Peanut Competitiveness. Some $250,000 was appropriated
for research on pickles. New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a
streetcar named Desire.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where
such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon
to the local economy. Business, civic and political leaders in
Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators
bringing home the bacon. This is why some fiscal conservatives may
be secretly breathing a sigh of relief and thanking the Supremes.
