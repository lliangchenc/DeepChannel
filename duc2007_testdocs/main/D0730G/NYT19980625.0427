   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the
Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by
vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old attempt
mostly by Congressional Republican leaders to strengthen the hand
of the president in struggles with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the
Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must
``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but
cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The president has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a
portion of each,'' said the majority opinion by Justice John Paul
Stevens. ``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform
with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single
finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing
the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and
tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many
states, would help eliminate the budget deficit. But the court said
Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' with the ruling. ``The decision is a defeat for all
Americans,'' he said. ``It deprives the president of a valuable
tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening
the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws,
eliminating 82 items, including money that would have gone to New
York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Challenges to those vetoes led to Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy chided
Congress for surrendering power to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' he declared. ``Abdication of responsibility is not part
of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Line-Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans'
Contract With America. Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House
members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty
of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the
president. ``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the
branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor
dissented, saying they would have upheld the line-item veto. Scalia
said ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing
the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item
veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens. John McCain of
Arizona and Daniel Coats of Indiana, both Republicans, said they
would keep fighting for it. They have proposed an alternative,
under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be
submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for
him to sign or veto. Under this arrangement, the president would
receive thousands of bills each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the Line-Item Veto Act ``gives the president the
unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In exercising the power, President Clinton has infuriated
members of Congress, including many who supported the device in
principle. Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining
that Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states. In
February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military
construction projects worth $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the
line-item veto, was ecstatic after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great
day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said. ``Today
we feel that the liberties of the American people have been
assured. God save this honorable Court!''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years,
expressed dismay at Breyer's opinion. Advocating a pragmatic view
of the Constitution, Breyer said the line-item veto was an
acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of
individual citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said this was ``a remarkable position to take.'' He quoted
Sir William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, who wrote:
``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the
right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and
the same man, or one and the same body of men. And wherever these
two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton
had used the device. In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that
there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers
had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York
hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual
injury.'' Justice Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating
a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could
harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, David
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority
opinion by Justice Stevens in the case, Clinton vs. City of New
York, No. 97-1374.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal
money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and
Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and
insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit,
even though they did not challenge President Clinton's actions in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the
Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a
tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a
lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for three House
Democrats opposed to the line item veto.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the
wisdom'' of the line item veto procedure. But, he said, if Congress
wants to establish such a procedure, it must amend the
Constitution.
