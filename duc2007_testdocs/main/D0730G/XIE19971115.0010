<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Congress Rejection of His Line-Item Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today vetoed a congressional rejection of his line-item veto on 38
military construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item
authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual
spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth
287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military
construction spending bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not
substantially improve the quality of life of military service
members and their families."
</P>
<P>
Then the Senate voted to disapprove of Clinton's veto of 36 of
the projects and the House voted to restore all the 38. As a
congressional version to kick the ball back to the president, the
Senate then agreed with the House to fully restore the projects.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-dominated congress will not let the matter over.
It can still override his veto with two-thirds votes in the House
and Senate when it resumes session next year.
