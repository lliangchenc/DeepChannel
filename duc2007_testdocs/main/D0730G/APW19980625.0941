Supreme Court invalidates president's line-item veto 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court struck down as
unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which
let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures.
	   Thursday's 6-3 decision said the law violates a stipulation in
the U.S. Constitution that requires every bill passed by the
Congress to be presented to the president for his signature of
approval or veto. The court said the constitutional language does
not allow what in effect would be partial vetoes.
	   The justices said that type of line-item veto could be
authorized only by amending the Constitution, an arduous process
done only 27 times in the document's 211-year history. The
line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho
potato growers' group after U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed
provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
	   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an
authority sought by almost every president this century as a tool
to limit wasteful politically based spending by Congress. Congress
enacted the veto in 1996, and Clinton used it 82 times last year.
