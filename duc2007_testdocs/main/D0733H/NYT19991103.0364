 &HT;    Copyright control at center of concern over King papers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Growing congressional concern about copyright
control over the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s private papers is
hampering negotiations to buy the collection from the slain civil
rights leader's family.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans and Democrats say that if federal funds are
used to purchase the papers for $20 million, then the Library of
Congress should own the copyright of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The King family has expressed an interest in retaining at least
partial copyright control, which would result in lucrative royalty
fees if the papers are used in a commercial fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Under such an agreement, if the collection of 80,000 documents
is used to create an educational computer program or to write a
book, royalties for the use of the King papers would go to the King
family.
</P>
<P>
   The King family would not comment directly about negotiations
over the copyright. Robert Vickers, a family spokesman, said a
statement by Dexter Scott King, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
son, on Oct. 27 still stands.
</P>
<P>
   King said then that by accepting a payment that is far below the
$30 million appraised value of the papers, the family was ``meeting
our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr. King while making
a substantial gift to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress,
said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the
library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain
rights when we obtain a collection, but we have allowed reasonable
restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past,''
Brett said. Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control
on literary works of noted authors and historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   But the purchase of the King papers is different, lawmakers say,
because the collection would be purchased, not donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to purchase or acquire the papers, we ought to
have full control over the papers,'' said Rep. John Boehner
(R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Administration Committee,
which has jurisdiction over the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) are working to bring legislation to the floor authorizing
the Library of Congress to purchase or acquire the papers through
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed such a measure, but the authorization is
stalled in the House over the copyright issue and over a sense
among members that the papers should be donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a president or any national figure who hasn't
donated their papers,'' said Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) ``The
papers are important, but this is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the civil rights movement agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this contradicts directly what Dr. King stood for and
believed in: that there are more important things than material
wealth,'' said Gilbert Jonas, a chief NAACP fund-raiser for 30
years who donated his own papers to the Library of Congress. ``The
man who stood for the spiritual values of this country is being
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas said he cannot think of any members of the civil rights
movement who sold their papers to the Library of Congress or other
institution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the commercialization of the King legacy that
has prompted concern.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are equally worried about the collection that will be
left behind at the King Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Cook, former director of the King Library's archives and
museum in Atlanta, said the papers that Congress wants to buy
include documents from King's involvement with the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said those papers were separated from another
collection of SCLC papers donated to the King Center in 1977,
because Coretta Scott King kept them at her house.
</P>
<P>
   The two collections should be kept together for historical
purposes, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any scholar would consider them to be inseparable,'' Cook
said. ``They are two separate collections, but had the documents
held by Mrs. King been available at the time, they would have been
considered as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Both collections contain similar documents, including
handwritten notes, drafts of speeches, reports and correspondence
with major civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   Cook left the King Center in 1987 over a fundamental
disagreement with the way the papers were being stored and concern
over the King estate charging fees to use the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gravely concerned about the future of the SCLC
collection, as it has a very significant historical value for our
nation and for scholars,'' Cook said. ``Because Dr. King was the
founding president of SCLC, I don't know how to distinguish what
was his and what was SCLC's.''
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and King
biographer, agrees with Cook's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question right now is what does this mean
for the SCLC papers and the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee) papers?'' Garrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, at the Library of Congress, said that the other papers
had not been considered as part of the negotiations.
