   The concept of poet laureate is British: an official court poet,
appointed by the king or queen. The first was Ben Jonson. Other
notable poet laureates have been John Dryden, William Wordsworth,
and Alfred Tennyson. The current British laureate is Andrew Motion.
Like his predecessors, he is paid about $300 a year and a cask of
white wine.

   The US poet laureateship began in 1937 as the position of
consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. In 1986, Senator
Spark Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, added the title ``poet
laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction when Congress passed the law,'' said
Stanley Kunitz, who is laureate-designate and was poetry consultant
from 1974 to 1976, ``was that no one can be poet laureate. . . . We
are such a diversified culture that to assume one is actually the
poet laureate of the American people is vainglorious.'' He added
with a laugh, ``But one does the best one can.''
</P>
<P>
   The job pays $35,000. Duties are few: Give a reading at the
start of the laureate's tenure, deliver an essay at the end, and
help organize the library's literary programs.
</P>
<P>
   The three most recent laureates, Rita Dove, Robert Hass, and
Robert Pinsky, have redefined the post from one that was almost
entirely honorary _ ``Life will go on exactly as before,'' said
Robert Penn Warren upon being named first laureate _ to one that
has become almost evangelical.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky has kept up a particularly energetic travel and speaking
schedule, which has led some to question whether a nonagenarian
like Kunitz is up to the job. ``It was a remarkable performance,
and nobody will ever duplicate it,'' Kunitz said. ``Naturally, I
don't intend to be _ how shall I phrase it? _ sedentary, though I
have no intention of being as much of an activist as Robert has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   US Poet Laureates have included: Robert Penn Warren, 1986-87;
Richard Wilbur, 1987-88; Howard Nemerov, 1988-90; Mark Strand,
1990-91; Joseph Brodsky, 1991-92; Mona Van Duyn, 1992-93; Rita
Dove, 1993-95; Robert Hass, 1995-97; Robert Pinsky, 1997-2000; and
Stanley Kunitz, 2000-01.
