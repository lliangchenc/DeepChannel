<P>
   I am no expert on history CD-ROMs. In truth, I have consciously
shied away from them, seeing digital tools as a frivolous assault
on scholarly standards. After spending a week playing with The
Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the
American experience through documents selected from the world's
largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward
Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his
faith. Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the
CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
</P>
<P>
   The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts. All
provide a glimpse of the treasures to be found in the Library of
Congress' fabulous special collections. (The DVD-ROM version has 19
additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three
hours of full-screen video.)
</P>
<P>
   Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps,
prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative
published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the
Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a
poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the
grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National
Cemetery (1943).
</P>
<P>
   Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along
chronological and thematic lines. Following a concise and
beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the
historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like
Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War. Each category contains
a time line covering the course of American history. A journey into
The African-African Experience, for example, elicits a dozen images
from the years 1947 to 1957, including those of Charlie Parker
playing the alto saxophone, Marian Anderson performing with the New
York Philharmonic, Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by the police in
Montgomery, Ala., and social psychologist Kenneth Clark performing
the doll study that swayed several Supreme Court justices in Brown
vs. Board of Education. All the images are accompanied by crisp
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits
created specifically for Eyes of the Nation. These include things
like the step-by-step construction of the U.S. Capitol and the
satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which
politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely
lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of
archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the
creative use of primary sources.
</P>
<P>
   Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American
Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands
of historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly
succeeds. All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in
portfolios created by users, and printed. All contain a written
commentary. The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on
the contents _ a good idea when reading an old letter or studying
battlefield maps.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete. While
including all the images, it does not search the larger text. So my
attempts to locate J. Edgar Hoover, Barry Goldwater and Donald Duck
turned up nothing. Are they somewhere on this CD-ROM? I have no
idea.
</P>
<P>
   There also appears to be no cross-referencing. Using the word
``tennis,'' I could find no match for Billie Jean King. She is
categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer
seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted
athlete Bella Abzug.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, my search for Dwight D. Eisenhower turned up a single
image, although I'm certain from my own browsing that there were at
least two.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems. After 1970, the project clearly loses
momentum. The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents
and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller.'' There is
little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the
extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political
road. You could easily come away from the images and commentary on
Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the
exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.
Nine images appear on the time line for War between 1970 and 1991.
One covers the shooting of student protesters at Kent State;
another focuses on ``Apocalypse Now,'' the ultimate anti-war film.
A third shows a CIA map of South Vietnam, but the commentary
ignores that image in favor of a diatribe against ``the
military-industrial complex.'' There are five separate images of
the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war. It shows a wall
of death at the University of Rochester, representing the thousands
of Iraqis who were killed in the conflict. There is no mention of
how the war began or who bears responsibility for the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Given the extraordinary scope and beauty of this project,
however, these are minor quibbles. Eyes of the Nation is not meant
to be a textbook. It is a compendium of sights and sounds,
celebration and protest, pop culture and seminal ideas, reminding
us of the richness and diversity of American life. On that level,
it is a stunning success.
