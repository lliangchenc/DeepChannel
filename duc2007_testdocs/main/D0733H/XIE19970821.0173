<HEADLINE> 7,700 Precious Tibetan Books Now in US Congress Library: US Librarian Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Susan Meinheit, librarian at the
U.S. Library of Congress, noted today that the facility houses a
collection of some 7,700 precious Tibetan books, most of which
were brought to the country by western diplomats and explorers.
</P>
<P>
"The collection includes more than 300 rare volumes and
original copies," according to Meinheit, who presented a detailed
paper and report to the library's Tibetan collection to the 1997
Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies which opened yesterday in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She said: "the library also has more than 300 xylographic and
hand-written manuscripts."
</P>
<P>
She noted that William Rockwill, U.S. envoy to China in 1905,
presented the library with 65 volumes of original Tibetan books,
including a rare edition of "Changtiao Shu" (plate book) wrapped
in yellow silk.
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note from Rockwill indicates that the book was a
gift from the 13th Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Changtiao Shu", a unique type of Tibetan book wrapped in fine
silk, consists of unbound xylographic pages in wooden covers.
</P>
<P>
Meinheit noted that two Americans -- Dr. Berthold Laufer
(1874-1934) and explorer Joseph Rock (1884-1962) -- were also
major contributors to the library. Laufer sold to the library the
Chien-lung Palace Edition of the Mahayana Sutra which was printed
in rare red ink.
</P>
<P>
Scholars with the Beijing Library note that a large number of
ancient Tibetan books can be found in numerous foreign countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
For example, a unique volume of the ancient Tibetan Medical
Dictionary, the oldest and most detailed publication of its kind,
is housed in London's Museum of Great Britain. Chinese scholars
must visit the museum to read, microfilm or copy the original.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Library, China's largest library, currently houses
a collection of 3,500 volumes of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, and
1,500 Tibetan studies books published since 1949.
