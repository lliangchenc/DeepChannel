LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TO BUY KING'S PAPERS FROM FAMILY FOR $20
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Library of Congress has reached a tentative
agreement with the family of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to
buy the slain civil rights leader's private papers for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though the price is the largest amount of money the Library of
Congress has ever paid for a collection of papers, some researchers
and students of the civil rights era question the historic value of
the material.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, first reported this week in Roll Call, a
Capitol Hill newspaper, the King family will transfer to the
library King's letters, notes, and first drafts of speeches which
are now at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta. The
collection, which is made up of about 80,000 items, was valued at
$30 million by Sotheby's, which did a private appraisal at the
request of the King family.
</P>
<P>
   The King family originally wanted the full $30 million, but when
Library officials balked, the family agreed to reduce the payment
request to $20 million and take a $10 million tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accepting a payment that is substantially below market
value, we are meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of
Dr. King while making a substantial gift to the nation,'' said a
statement issued in the name of Dexter Scott King, the civil rights
leader's son who now heads the King Center in Atlanta and is
executor of the King estate.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to Congress passing legislation
appropriating money for the library to buy the King collection. The
Senate passed such a measure by unanimous consent Friday. Sponsors
of the House bill say they hope to gain passage within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress rarely spends money to acquire historic
documents. Since the library is the Copyright Office of the United
States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that
are published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930,
when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that
included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible. To
date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are
worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
The King family retains control of the official papers of civil
rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student
Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee. These papers are currently
housed at the King Center, and will remain there.

<P>
   ``Ask anybody who is a historian of the movement, and they would
say that the SNCC papers are worth more to scholars than the King
papers,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and
author of ``Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr., and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1997, both Stanford University and Emory entered into
negotiations with the King family to buy some of the papers housed
at the King Center. But the two universities were not really
interested in the material that now may be sold to the Library of
Congress, according to Phillip Jones, chairman of Intellectual
Properties Management, an Atlanta company that oversees the King
estate.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the payments the King family will receive
from the library will be used to maintain official documents like
the SCLC papers that are still housed at the King Center. Some
historians say they fear that should the originals of King's
personal papers be removed from the King Center, the King family
will lose interest in protecting the rest of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has long been a repository of the papers
or leaders and organizations of the African American civil rights
movement. Among the official papers housed there are those of The
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and
the private papers of A. Phillip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall,
Booker T. Washington and Bayard Rustin.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
</P>
<P>
   The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question
of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy
of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to
many Americans of all races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it
included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March
on Washington. The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I
have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial
harmony and justice. Last year, a federal judge in Washington
denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is amazing, isn't it?'' said Gilbert Jonas, one of
the chief fund-raisers for the NAACP for 30 years who recently
donated his papers to the library. ``They're first ones, in my
knowledge, from the civil rights era who have made money on it.
They're really creating an image that was counter to his.''
</P>
<P>
   But others defend the King family's right to earn money. ``I
never quite understood why the issue of money was used against the
King family when any other family that owns a valuable piece of
property would not be expected to just give it away,'' said
Clayburn Carson, a history professor at Stanford who was involved
in the negotiations to purchase many of the papers from the King
Center in 1997.
