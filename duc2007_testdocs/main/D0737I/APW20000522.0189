<HEADLINE> British Firm Eyes Swissair Gem Hunt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The provincial government is
weighing a request by Lloyd's of London to search the Swissair
crash site for $300 million in diamonds and jewels reportedly
aboard the plane, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The British firm, through a Canadian insurance company, has
asked the Nova Scotia government for permission to hunt for the
valuables, said CBC-TV, Canada's national broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean just off Nova Scotia
on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 passengers on board. The cause of
the crash still hasn't been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's manifest indicates that 4{ pounds of diamonds and 11
pounds of jewelry were aboard when it went down. The valuables have
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The reports said the insurance company plans to use a
mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in
about 200 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds were reportedly in a stainless steel tube, which
may have disintegrated on impact or been driven deep into the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's told CBC-TV last week that it hopes to begin the search
this summer. Lloyd's officials in London were unavailable for
comment Monday evening and calls to a spokesman's cell phone were
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Nova Scotia Natural Resources Minister Ernie Fage has said the
government will make a decision on whether to allow the search in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fage said he wouldn't rule out allowing it, adding that he will
consider concerns of family members.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shaw, whose daughter died in the crash, argued before the
Nova Scotia legislature Friday that no one should be allowed to
''rake through'' the site. He said other relatives of the victims
also opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who
represents communities near the crash site, wants the province to
reject any treasure trove application ''because of the sacredness
of the site.''
