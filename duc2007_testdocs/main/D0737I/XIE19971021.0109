<HEADLINE> First Sea-Bed Antarctic Rock Sample Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A multinational scientific
team has recovered the first rock sample from deep beneath the
Antarctic ocean bed in a bid to reveal what happened in the frozen
continent 30-100 million years ago, an Australian earth scientist
on the team said today.
</P>
<P>
Ken Woolfe from James Cook University in Australia's northern
Queensland state said 51 scientists from six countries were
involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
James Cook University is the only Australian signatory to the
International Cape Roberts Project involving the research on the
Antarctic which got underway earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"My own work will involve looking at the description of the
rocks and interpreting the environment in which they were formed,"
Woolfe was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the scientists were excited by the project because
nothing was known about what happened in the Antarctic when the
ice sheet was first forming.
</P>
<P>
"We think we'll find there was a time when there was no ice at
all in the Antarctic. We don't know how it occurred or when it
occurred," he said.
</P>
<P>
By being able to understand the past, scientists would be
better able to predict the future and understand how the Antarctic
would react to global warming, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If all the ice in the Antarctic melted at once, sea levels all
over the Earth would rise by 60 meters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Woolfe said the research, the largest ever scientific project
undertaken in the Antarctic, was fraught with potential logistical
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
"What we've basically done is putting a drilling rig on the sea
ice, then drilled through the ice and water and then finally 400
meters into the seabed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to have exactly the right conditions, which really
only gives us about eight to 10 weeks to work in."
</P>
<P>
He said the weather had to be cold enough to keep the ice
stable yet not so cold that it made the steel of the 20-tonne
drilling rig brittle.
</P>
<P>
Violent storms which could fracture the ice and potentially
plunge the rig into the ocean posed another risk for the
researchers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high risks involved, the research team lives at
a camp 10 kilometers from the drilling site and members are flown
to the rig by helicopter to work on 12-hour shifts in minus 21
Celsius centigrade conditions.
</P>
<P>
Besides the scientists, 20 drilling and support staff from
Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Germany and
Britain are involved in the project which will continue drilling
until the end of November and then resume next summer.
