<HEADLINE> China Pushes Forward Deep Sea Mining For Rare Metals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has announced it is to
draw up boundaries for its exclusive mineral mining operations in
75,000 square kilometers of the eastern section of the Pacific
Ocean where it intends to intensify its exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China was officially recognized by the United Nations
as one of the pioneering investors in international seabed
exploration and acquired the mining right in an area of 150,000 sq.
km of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
After surveys indicated poor reserves in large tracts of the
original zone, China has given up the right for about half of the
area. It will now concentrate on the new, smaller mining zone
which geologists estimate could have an annual production capacity
of three million tons of rare metals such as manganese, nickel and
cobalt. The reserves are expected to last for at least 20 years,
which will help ease the shortage of such rare metals in China
throughout the early part of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The newly designated area is estimated to contain about 112
million tons of manganese, 4 million tons of copper, 5 million
tons of nickel and 980,000 tons of cobalt.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Xianglong, an academician at the Chinese
Academy of Engineering (CAE), the metals and minerals are
scattered on the sea-bed "like potatoes".
</P>
<P>
He added, "China has now acquired the advanced technology to
pick up these 'potatoes like' lumps of rock and metal from the
deep sea."
</P>
<P>
After much research Chinese engineers have developed a robot
which can operate 6,000 meters underwater and will be used in such
deep-sea mining.
</P>
<P>
However, this type of exploration requires high technology and
a large investment with a concurrent high risk factor, warned Jin
Jiancai, secretary-general of the China Ocean Mineral Resources
Research and Development Association.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the need to find more reserves of rare metals on the
ocean beds, Jin went on to say that because of the pace of
development in technologies, modern instruments and
telecommunications, China's land-based rare metals resources only
have a further 30 to 50 years of life.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the shortage of rare metals would have great
impact on people's lives," said Wang Dianzuo, vice president of
the CAE.
</P>
<P>
He explained, for example, that the batteries used in mobile
phones consume a large amount of nickel every year. "If those
nickel resources are exhausted, people will lose the convenience
brought about by mobile phones," he said, adding the crisis will
also appear in other areas using products needing rare minerals
and metals.
