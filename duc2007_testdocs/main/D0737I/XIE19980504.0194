<HEADLINE> China Using Steel Caissons to Develop Oil in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Since April last year, China has
successfully been using steel caissons to develop oil in the
Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
A cylindrical steel caisson, 13.8 meters tall and 38 meters in
diameter, was put in April last year on the seabed in the
oilfield's eastern section, where it has been used as a platform
for drilling and storage of oil, according to Jiang Hengyu,
manager in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has used this technology in
offshore oil production, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the new technology effectively prevents
sedimentation and icing on a drilling platform, and a new
10-meter-thick oil-bearing stratum has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou 9-3, which is 20 km from the city of Jinzhou in
Liaoning Province, has proven oil reserves of 30.8 million
tons. The oilfield was discovered by the Bohai Oil Company in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The water over the oilfield is 7 m deep, making conventional
oil development methods costly and difficult for recovering
investment. After eight years of study, petroleum engineers
decided to use the steel caissons for efficiency and safety.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield's eastern section will not have any living
facilities, but will be linked with the other section by a 2.7-km
marine pipeline and a marine cable.
</P>
<P>
The caissons for the western section have been completed and
are expected to be installed soon, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou Oilfield is expected to have 27 production wells,
26 water filling wells, and one natural gas well, and a designed
annual capacity of a million tons. The oilfield will cost 1.8
billion yuan and will go into production in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu of
Tianjin in 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets and
10,000 employees.
