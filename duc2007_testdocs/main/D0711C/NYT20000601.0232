MICROSOFT JUDGE WILL POSTPONE FINAL RULING FOR ABOUT A WEEK 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust
case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a
week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's
proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up
plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to
issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of
the company, Thursday or Friday. But the Justice Department asked
him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on
the government's remedy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and
Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
</P>
<P>
   In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the
company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the
proposed decree prior to its entry.'' Lawyers interpreted that to
mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the
government proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed
to break Microsoft into two companies. One would hold the Windows
operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office
suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for
spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also put in place almost immediately a wide
range of remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct while the
breakup is being carried out. Microsoft's comments would delay all
of the remedies and heavily modify most of them.
