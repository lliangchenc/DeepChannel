   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ Between a beach he loved and the site where
his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes
and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to
the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
</P>
<P>
   In a private, closely guarded ceremony aboard a US Navy
destroyer, the remains of Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, her 34-year-old sister, were laid
in the choppy Atlantic Ocean. The ceremony occurred in view of the
shorefront estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, and near where his small plane plunged into the sea last
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the mercies of God, a Roman Catholic priest and two
Navy chaplains presided over a brief, solemn ceremony on the deck
of the USS Briscoe. Meanwhile, three miles away, the USS Grasp, a
Navy salvage ship continued retrieving the wreckage of Kennedy's
shattered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   One to three members at a time, the grieving family members cast
the ashes to the ocean. A Navy brass quintet played, but the
familiar strains of Taps was not heard at this non-military
ceremony rarely allowed on a Navy ship for a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   All along the shoreline of southwestern Martha's Vineyard,
vacationers and Vineyarders, gripped for days by news of Kennedy's
disappearance and the grim discovery of his remains, watched with
the drama from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel devastated,'' said Pat Mutolo, a vacationer from
Rochester, N.Y., whose voice broke with emotion as she watched the
Briscoe's progress. ``I woke up to the news Saturday morning and
said, `Oh, my God.' No family deserves this.''
</P>
<P>
   The service, which concluded nearly a week of intense emotions
after JFK Jr.'s plane was reported missing last Friday, began at
9:30 a.m. as the funeral party, led by Kennedy's uncle, US Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, left the family compound at Hyannis Port for
Woods Hole. There, the Briscoe, a guided-missile destroyer
transported them to the burial site.
</P>
<P>
   The warship moved at a processional pace past the jagged Gay
Head cliffs and the beaches where bits of Kennedy's airplane were
found.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which began shortly before noon, was witnessed by
about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including
Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters'
mother, stepfather and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The party listened as the clergymen conducted the moving ritual
of committing human remains to the sea. Kennedy's sister and uncle
spoke at the somber service, which fulfilled John Kennedy Jr.'s
wishes to be buried at sea _ and away from the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by Coast Guard vessels, the crew of the Briscoe ensured
that privacy in a strictly enforced security zone that kept the
news media, in chartered boats and TV helicopters, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the use of the Briscoe,
which was diverted from maneuvers in the North Atlantic to become
the platform for a nationally riveting funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were recovered
Wednesday afternoon, and their ashes scattered less than 24 hours
after Navy divers lifted the bodies feet from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapid turn of events, hundreds of mourners and the
curious lined the southwest shoreline of Martha's Vineyard from Gay
Head to the wild beaches along Moshup Trail, near the estate that
Kennedy and his sister had inherited from their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cami Stephens of Hyannis, watching the Briscoe return to Woods
Hole, said she wanted to bid farewell to Kennedy, someone she knew
and admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down-to-earth _ someone who'd get coffee up the street,
someone who'd say `Hi,' '' explained Stephens, who said she has
been part of many get-togethers at the compound in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his family ``would make you feel like you were
someone,'' she said. ``This, to me, it's like a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners arrived in Woods Hole about 9:30 a.m. and were
quickly transported to the Briscoe by the Coast Guard vessel
Sanibel. Close to 10 a.m., the Briscoe pulled up anchor and began
its journey around Gay Head in choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:20 a.m., four miles off the southern shore of Martha's
Vineyard, the ship stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crew then completed preparations for a ceremony that lasted
roughly 30 minutes. The service was attended by dozens of Briscoe
crew members outfitted in dress-white uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the mourners returned to Woods Hole at 3:30
p.m. Sen. Kennedy and the funeral party then proceeded to Hyannis
Port for a private reception. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of
assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s
cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a fledgling pilot, was at the controls of a
newly-purchased, high-performance airplane from Fairfield, N.J. to
Martha's Vineyard last Friday just after sunset, en route to a
cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight _ and less than 20
miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport _ Kennedy's plane vanished
from air-traffic control radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Though the exact cause of the crash is not yet known,
authorities believe Kennedy lost control of the single-engine
airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the
murky night sky. The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying
corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision,
aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting
the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast
Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology
government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras,
Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early
Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped
into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have
been sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies
of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette. At 7:15 p.m. that night, the
remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne,
where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard J.
Evans and Dr. James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims'
families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies,
fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid
press or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial Mass for Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette is scheduled
for 11 a.m. Friday at St. Thomas More Church in New York, where
Kennedy's mother often prayed. President and Hillary Clinton plan
to attend. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette is set for 7 p.m.
Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.
