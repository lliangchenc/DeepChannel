<HEADLINE> John F. Kennedy Plane Reported Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A small plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. president, was reported
missing early Saturday, and a search was under way off the coast
of New York's Long Island, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The plane left an airfield in New Jersey State at 8:45 p.m.(
local time) Friday and was believed to be carrying Kennedy and his
wife Carolyn Bessette to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State,
where the Kennedy family was gathering for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed it was searching for the plane
with help from the Air National Guard. The search was being
conducted in water off eastern tip of Long Island, along the
presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Gaspar, an operations specialist at Martha's Vineyard
Airport, said Kennedy's plane was supposed to arrive Friday night,
but never did.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little worried, because I know him personally," Gaspar
said.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Martin, who described himself as a friend of the family,
said he was told Kennedy was headed for Martha's Vineyard and was
then to go to the wedding of a cousin, Rory, daughter of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement from the office of U.S.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the couple was to be married Saturday
before 275 guests in a private ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy family contacted the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) when the plane was overdue, and the agency
began checking airports along the route, a source said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard and Air National Guard then started a search.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of the 35th president,
and was born just two months before his father's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
His father's assassination immediately thrust him into the
public eye with the poignant photo of the little boy saluting as
his funeral procession passed.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics.
After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school and
joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.
