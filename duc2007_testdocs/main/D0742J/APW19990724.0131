<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife died, many  
people wondered what had happened to the couple's dog, Friday, who 
was frequently seen around the city with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The black and white dog is safe -- it was apparently taken to  
Massachusetts by a close friend of Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy, shortly after their plane disappeared last weekend, said a 
law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News first reported on Thursday that the dog was alive  
and living in Massachusetts with the couple's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if the Kennedys' cat was also in  
Massachusetts.
