   NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday
off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the
authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the debris included part of the plane's landing
gear and a prescription bottle with Carolyn Kennedy's name on it.
Also recovered was a black suitcase with a business card bearing
the name of Lauren G. Bessette, 34, an investment banker for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Kennedy's sister-in-law. The suitcase and
other debris were found on a beach about two miles from the
Martha's Vineyard estate once owned by Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding
of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. Ms. Kennedy was
to be married yesterday before 275 guests. The wedding was
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard cutters and an Air National Guard helicopter
equipped with an infrared scanning device continued through the
night to search for any survivors from the single-engine plane the
Kennedys were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to give up on this yet,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left from Essex
County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on Friday and was
scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last
contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a
statement. When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family
notified the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Saturday, a white tent
stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
A Mass was said on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel
Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying
``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her
fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the
35th president. He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, weeks after his
father's election, and was known to the nation as ``John-John.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the
funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and
shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St. Matthew's Cathedral
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Given his celebrity and pedigree, word of Kennedy's
disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the
corridors of the White House to the major networks, which broke
into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland, was told about the plane's
disappearance shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called several members of the Kennedy family,
including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, the
husband of Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the plane's disappearance remained a mystery
Saturday. Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did
not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air
controllers during the flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the
Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod. About 3:30 a.m.
Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency
beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the
Kennedy airplane. Later Saturday morning, two boaters found some
debris floating off the Connecticut coast. That, too, was a false
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies joined the search. The Air National Guard
dispatched a C-130 cargo plane. Fifteen planes from the Civil Air
Patrol were searching, too.
</P>
<P>
   New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police
Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early
Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment
to make sure he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's
plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early
Saturday afternoon. That, combined with an analysis of information
captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts
along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard,
the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren
Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off
Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's
Vineyard. Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police
Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday
morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore
between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday. The man, a lawyer whom
Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low,
perhaps 40 feet over the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed
off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the
passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope. But as
the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors
were fading with each passing hour.
</P>
<P>
   Navy salvage experts were consulted. An oceanographic survey
ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine
the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths
of up to 100 feet in the search area.
</P>
<P>
   Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with
searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater
Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which
investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an
investigation of the plane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the
airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar
Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years,
said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m. Friday as they walked
toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of
the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight
checks. One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their
engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking
area, he said. But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with
the plane,'' Bailey said. ``It just caught my attention, like, `Why
is he doing this here?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading
south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard. Bailey, who flew to
Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be
hazardous, especially at night.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or
cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use
to piece together the details of jet crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the
pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other
traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in
the area was poor, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard
to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who
left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to
his home in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult
maintaining the airplane in an upright condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which
operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the
process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to
fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.
</P>
<P>
   While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age _
personally and professionally _ in New York City. He grew up with
his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.
After graduating from New York University Law School in 1989, he
went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Kennedy was the constant object of media
attention. He was crowned ``The Sexiest Man Alive,'' and
``America's Most Eligible Bachelor.'' The rise and fall of his
romance with the actress Daryl Hannah spilled across the front
pages of the tabloids. When he twice failed his bar examination,
that, too, was front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a minor miracle, then, that Kennedy managed to marry
Ms. Bessette in 1996 in near secrecy on a secluded island off
Georgia. Ms. Bessette Kennedy, who had worked in public relations
for Calvin Klein, was immediately anointed a ``symbol of American
style,'' by Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar.
There seemed no limit to the public appetite for gossip about the
couple. Even a quarrel with his wife _ videotaped by a stranger _
was broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kennedy seemed to have settled into his work as
editor of George, a flashy monthly magazine about politics that he
started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette Kennedy, 33, is a year younger than her sister,
Lauren Bessette, who is a principal in the investment banking
division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. A graduate of Hobart
College, Ms. Bessette joined the company about six years ago, and
was based in Hong Kong for several years. She has an identical
twin, Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator, and
their stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, live
in Connecticut. A woman who answered the telephone at their home
declined to comment Saturday. Their father, William Bessette, an
architectural engineer, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, a Kennedy wedding became a vigil. Christina
Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal party before
attending the wedding as a guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''
Ms. Rivers said. ``It's just not fair.''
