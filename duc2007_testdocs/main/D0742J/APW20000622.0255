<HEADLINE> Report: Ruling on Kennedy Crash Due  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators have concluded pilot error
caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is finalizing its
report, which is expected to be released in the next several weeks,
according to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use the words ''pilot error,'' however, the NTSB is
likely to attribute the cause to Kennedy becoming ''spatially
disoriented,'' which is when a pilot loses track of the plane's
position in the sky, NBC reported.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night
of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard: thick haze, the darkness
of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no
lights below to guide him.
</P>
<P>
   But the NTSB is not expected to criticize Kennedy's experience,
and will not address the question of whether pilots without
instrument rating should be allowed to fly at night, NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not have instrument rating, meaning he was not
qualified to fly by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as he was flying
with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren,
from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Terry Williams told The Associated Press that he
had no information about the Kennedy crash report, saying only that
the report will be released in several weeks.
