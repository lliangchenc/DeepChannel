<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Kennedy Crash Marked  </HEADLINE>

   BOSTON (AP) -- One year ago, a late-night plane crash off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard claimed the life of one of America's
favorite sons.
</P>
<P>
   An entire nation grieved the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
Flowers were mounded outside the New York building where the couple
had lived, and photos of the former president's son filled the
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the first anniversary of the July 16, 1999, crash
passed quietly as relatives and friends mourned in private.
</P>
<P>
   A small driftwood memorial was built on the Vineyard's Philbin
Beach, closest to the area where the plane went down. But aside
from the wooden cross, which bore only the words: ''John, Carolyn
and Lauren,'' little was done to publicly recognize the tragic
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial,'' said Anne
McGhee, a Harvard University professor who has a home on Martha's
Vineyard. ''We just know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Freeman, mother of Carolyn, 33, and Lauren, 34, released a
statement from her home in Greenwich, Conn., last week saying the
family would not mark the anniversary publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., an uncle to Kennedy, 38,
planned to spend the weekend with his family at the Kennedy
compound in Barnstable's Hyannis Port section.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very quiet,'' said Barnstable Police Officer
James Ellis. ''We've had patrols out all week and we haven't had a
problem yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the waters late
at night, seven miles south of the Kennedy home on Martha's
Vineyard as he was flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory
Kennedy's wedding. The National Transportation Safety Board
determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy
likely became disoriented in the night sky.
