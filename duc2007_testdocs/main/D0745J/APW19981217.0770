IRS seeks dlrs 6.5 million from Nicole Brown Simpson estate

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The U.S. federal tax agency wants the estate
of Nicole Brown Simpson to pay dlrs 6.5 million in taxes, a claim
based on a dlrs 12 million civil judgment against O.J. Simpson that
was never paid, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
	   Brown said Wednesday he is appealing the Internal Revenue
Service demand, which was made in September, because ex-football
star O.J. Simpson has ``not paid one penny'' of the dlrs 12 million
wrongful-death judgment against him.
	   ``There's been no money collected, and no basis for that lien.
So we said, `IRS, you're nuts,''' said Louis H. Brown, Ms.
Simpson's father and administrator of her trust.
	   The estate, created to support the Simpsons' two children,
petitioned the U.S. Tax Court in Washington last week to intervene
after failing to reach an agreement with IRS officials, Brown said.
	   IRS spokeswoman Laurie Kellerman said the agency is seeking to
collect dlrs 6.5 million in estate taxes, but declined to comment
further. Lawyers for Simpson also declined comment.
	   O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay dlrs 33.5 million to the estates
and heirs of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The two
were knifed to death June 12, 1994.
	   Simpson was acquitted of murder, but a civil jury found him
liable for the deaths and awarded the victims' families dlrs 33.5
million in damages.
