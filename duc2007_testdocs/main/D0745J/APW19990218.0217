<HEADLINE>  Pa. Man Bought Simpson's Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who paid $255,500 for O.J. Simpson's  
Heisman Trophy was identified Thursday as a Philadelphia sheet 
metal dealer who said he wanted to impress his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, showed up at an auction house to  
collect the trophy, which was awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he 
was a star at the University of Southern California. Kriessman 
bought the prize anonymously at a court-ordered auction of Simpson 
memorabilia Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the first reasons was I wanted to impress my  
girlfriend,'' Kriessman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents the story of a man who rose to be a superstar  
and lost it all overnight. I bought it for everything it 
represents: The trial of the century, O.J.'s whole career, what 
happened -- you know, the tragedy that was his life. I just think in 
the future it's going to be worth a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman was given the same nickname as Simpson when he played  
rough touch football in his 20s in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend, whom Kriessman didn't identify, apparently  
wasn't the only one impressed by the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's been calling,'' he said. ``Seems everybody wants  
to touch it, everybody wants to be photographed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman is the co-owner of Triad Steel Inc, a 10-year-old  
company that buys and sells sheet metal. Partner Edward O'Brien 
said Triad has annual sales of about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction raised $430,000 to help pay off the $33.5 million a  
jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the 
slayings of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman also bought a couple of jerseys and a glass trophy,  
but the Heisman was the top-ticket item. 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman, a Philadelphia Eagles fan, said he has never met  
Simpson. Asked if he would like to hear from the former Buffalo 
Bills star and perhaps pose with him and the Heisman, he said: 
``I'd have to think about it.''
