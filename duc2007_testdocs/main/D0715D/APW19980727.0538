Spain destroys first batch of antipersonnel mines
</HEADLINE>

	   CACERES, Spain (AP) _ Spain began destroying its stockpile of
over 800,000 anti-personal landmines Monday, in compliance with
last December's Ottawa treaty.
	   The first three mines were symbolically incinerated at an
explosives factory near this western Spanish city by Defense
Minister Eduardo Serra, ministry spokesman Antonio Castro said.
	   About 1,000 mines are due to pass through the factory's
incinerators every day for over two years at a total cost of over
500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.3 million).
	   A small proportion of the mines will be kept for use in training
exercises, Castro said.
	   An international draft treaty banning the production, export and
use of landmines was signed by 121 nations in Ottawa, Canada last
December.
	   The treaty allowed four years for the destruction of all
stockpiled land mines, and 10 years for the deactivation of
minefields. Serra told reporters that Spain was at ``the vanguard''
of landmine destruction.
	   The ministry is destroying Spanish landmines, leaving a question
mark over what will happen to mines belonging to United States
military bases in Spanish territory, Castro said.
	   The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not
obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have
been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their
borders.
	   An estimated 100 million antipersonnel mines are deployed in
about 60 countries worldwide, often killing or crippling people
decades after a conflict has ended.
