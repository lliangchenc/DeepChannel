<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Sign Landmine-Banning Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Campaign
Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the
United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
</P>
<P>
The call coincides with Clinton's 11-day tour of six African
countries, namely Ghana, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Botswana
and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Wednesday, the group said it is
ironic the American leader is visiting Africa to discuss economic
recovery support.
</P>
<P>
But it said one of the most critical impending recovery on the
continent is the millions of hectares of land that cannot be
developed as a result of millions of explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
The group said Africa is a continent solidly behind a treaty
prohibiting production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38 African countries, including the 14 members of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have signed
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government refuses to approve it.
</P>
<P>
However, the anti-landmine campaign said all the countries
Clinton is touring have played major roles in global efforts to
create a mine-free world.
</P>
<P>
The South African lobby group said while Clinton travels
through Africa, it is collecting signatures protesting against
U.S. policy on the explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a former producer,destroyed more than three
million of its anti-personnel landmine stockpiles before it
signed the international convention last year.
