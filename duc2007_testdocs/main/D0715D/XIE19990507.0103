<HEADLINE> Angola to Continue Use of Land Mines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister,
Toko Serrao said here Thursday that Angola, which is still locked
in a civil war, will continue to use anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
Serrao made the remarks at the on-going meeting of the
signatory states of the convention on the prohibition of the use,
storage, production and transference of anti-personnel land mines
being held in Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Serrao is the first Angolan senior official to make a speech at
the meeting which started on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government has been criticized these days for not
observing the land mine prohibition convention, which the Angolan
government signed on December 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A report titled "Toward a Mine-free World Monitor Report 1999"
said that both the government and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had used anti-personnel land
mines after they were thrown into renewed civil war in late1998.
</P>
<P>
An investigator with an international mines prohibition
campaign even said new land mine zones had cropped up in eastern
Angola's Luena district, and that the local government prevented
any move of clearing land mines in the area.
</P>
<P>
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does
not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in
Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from
over 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
It is said that one out of 415 Angolans has been a victim of
land mine in this southern African country with a population of 12
million.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Namibia are the four countries which suffer most from land mines
in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people were killed by land mines and another
500,000 injured by them in this region in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The land mine prohibition meeting, which has attracted about
1,000 representatives from 72 countries and organizations
including the United Nations, will come to a close Friday.
