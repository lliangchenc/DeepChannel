<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The treaty-signing conference on
a global ban on landmines concluded here today, with 121 countries
put their signatures onto the document.
</P>
<P>
The treaty goes into effect six months after 40 countries
ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Those who have signed then have four years to destroy their
stockpiles of landmines and 10 years to clear minefields.
</P>
<P>
The signing here is "just a beginning", Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy told the 500-plus delegates from
government, non-government organizations and international
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We must act now and seize the moment," he said, waving a thick
document titled An Agenda for Mine Action.
</P>
<P>
The document was a "framework of a blueprint" and it "sets out
directions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in
September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines.
