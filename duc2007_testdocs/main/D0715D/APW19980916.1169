	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Burkino Faso became the 40th country to
ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines
Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months,
the United Nations announced.
	   Carol Bellamy, director of the United Nations Children's Fund,
was to travel to Bosnia on Thursday to mark the occasion.
	   The treaty was signed by more than 120 countries at a landmark
meeting in Ottawa last December. Nations that ratify the treaty
pledged to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and
clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years.
	   Forty countries needed to ratify the treaty for it to take
effect. With Burkina Faso's ratification, the treaty will go into
force in March, after a preparatory period of six months, U.N.
officials said.
	   ``Today, the world has taken a step toward becoming a safer and
more humane place,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a
statement. The treaty ``will have far-reaching implications for
both mine-affected and mine-producing countries.''
	   Carol Bellamy, director of the U.N. International Children's
Fund, congratulated the countries that ratified the treaty.
	   ``We stand at an historic moment in the struggle to end the
anguish that these weapons have already inflicted on tens of
thousands of the world's children, their families and their
communities,'' she said in a statement.
	   The United States has refused to ratify the treaty, arguing that
such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter an
invasion by North Korea of South Korea.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and an estimated 20,000 people are killed or injured
each year, mostly innocent civilians.
	   Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and
its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122
countries signing the treaty in Ottawa.
	   With Williams as campaign coordinator, the ICBL grew into a
global movement, backed by more than 1,000 organizations and
millions of people, including Britain's late Princess Diana.
