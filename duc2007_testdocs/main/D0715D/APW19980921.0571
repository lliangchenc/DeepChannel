U.N. refugee agency welcomes ratification of land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The ratification of a treaty aimed at eliminating
anti-personnel land mines will make the task of returning refugees
to former war zones easier and safer, the U.N. refugee agency said
Monday.
	   As well as preventing future laying of land mines, it will
encourage authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Mozambique
and elsewhere to do more mine clearing, said U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   The ratification would also help reduce refugees' reluctance to
return to their homes because they fear that mines are still buried
nearby, he said.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles
of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory
within 10 years.
	   UNHCR estimates that up to 700,000 mines are still planted in
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina which were in the front line during the
war. ``The mine pollution is enormous,'' Janowski said.
	   In a press release, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata welcomed the ratification of the treaty, entitled the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and their Destruction.
	   ``It's a gigantic step toward the safety of returning
refugees,'' Ogata said.
	   The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999. The United Nations
made the announcement last Wednesday after the West African nation
of Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact.
	   The treaty required ratification by 40 nations and their
legislatures to go into effect in those countries.
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify it, maintaining
that mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea
from invading South Korea. Russia and China are also holding out,
contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians.
