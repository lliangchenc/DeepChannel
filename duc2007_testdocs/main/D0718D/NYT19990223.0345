   SEATTLE _ While maps looking like they came from a Pentagon
situation room flashed on a huge screen behind him, Starbucks Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz stood before a happy house
of shareholders Tuesday and touted the progress in bringing the
company's brand of coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a truly enduring global brand,'' said Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks' global juggernaut is on track with plans this year to
open 500 stores around the world, Schultz said to an annual meeting
filled with people rejoicing over Monday's announcement of a
2-for-1 split of its shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The split will be in the form of a stock dividend payable on
March 19 for shareholders of record on March 5. Starbucks closed
yesterday at $52.375, up $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has 100 stores in Pacific Rim countries such
as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand, with plans to have 500
stores in the Pacific Rim by 2003. And a beachhead has been
established in Europe with the acquisition last May of the Seattle
Coffee Co. in the United Kingdom. The company's expansion program
continues in the United States as well. At year end, the company
owned 1,688 stores in 32 states, the District of Columbia, four
Canadian provinces and the U.K. It is projected to have 2,336
stores by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive expansion program is fueling the company's steady
growth in revenues and earnings with about 84 percent of net
revenues coming from the retail stores. Net revenues rose from
$975.4 million in fiscal 1997 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 1998, ``due
primarily to the company's store expansion program and comparable
store sales increases,'' according to the annual report. The report
goes on to note that the company ``has experienced a certain level
of cannibalization of existing stores by new stores as the store
concentration has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   But operating margins have grown or maintained a steady pace
since 1994 with the exception of 1996 when a South America freeze
cause coffee prices to spike. The margin for 1998 was unchanged
from 1997 at 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz took a shot at those who might think that Starbucks
can't sustain such growth over the long term. ``The cynics will say
that Starbucks has 2,000 stores and we're nearing saturation,''
said Schultz. ``We are not.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers, an analyst for D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland,
agreed. ``There are probably selected markets where you have an
abundance of coffee vendors,'' he said. ``But overall, for most of
the country, you are a probably quite a ways from saturation. The
evidence of that is the continued growth in same store sales (open
at least a year). Stores that have been there for a long time are
still putting up very good numbers, they are still growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz noted that the company enjoys the highest degree of
frequency of any retail store in America with the average customer
coming in 18 times a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company has big plans to continue leveraging that loyalty to
its brand built so carefully at the retail coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has tapped the Pepsi-Cola Co.'s ``ubiquitous
distribution power'' to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee
beverage which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said
Schultz. The CEO's prediction for revenues from Frappuccino: ``We
believe Frappuccino will be bigger than Starbucks is today.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the fourth quarter, Starbucks joined Kraft
Foods, Inc. in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell
its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in
America,'' said Schultz. ``We are going to have much, much more
than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz, in paying tribute to Howard Behar, who has been
overseeing the company's expansion overseas and plans to retire
this year, said Behar has been at the heart of Starbucks corporate
culture. It is a culture, said Schultz, that puts a premium on
nurturing relationships with both employees and the communities in
which it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the overseas expansion, Behar said: ``Starbucks set out to be
a bridge among peoples and among cultures, not to sell more
coffee.''
