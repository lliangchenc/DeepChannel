 _ SF CHRON  
 Why Starbucks Bid for Williams-Sonoma  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It seems absurd: The world's biggest coffee shop, Starbucks Corp.,
trying to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., a seller of leather armchairs
and mixing bowls.
<P>
   Starbucks' acquisition offer, rebuffed by San Francisco's
Williams-Sonoma earlier this month, was unexpected because it
ignored the conventional rules of retail mergers. Typically such
deals tout synergistic benefits in areas like real estate, buying
raw goods or marketing _ none of which have much traction in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer,
proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an
Internet play _ an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on
Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, such a combination would have made no sense.
Even today it seems a bit wacky. But it also provides a striking
example of how the digital world is redefining businesses as analog
as a double decaf macchiato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business as usual is dead and the rule book has been thrown
out,'' said Jamie Owens, president of the Retail Group, a Seattle
consulting firm. Companies today ``are not fish nor fowl, they've
got fins and feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks declined to comment on the acquisition attempt, first
reported in The Chronicle on Friday, and Williams-Sonoma will say
only that it is not for sale. Sources say that Williams-Sonoma's
board voted to reject Starbucks' overture in an emergency meeting
in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers see the move as vintage Howard Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, is proving as ambitious on
the Web as he has been with physical stores. This is a man who, a
decade ago, looked at a country where coffee is available on every
street corner and proceeded to roll out a national chain of coffee
bars. Now he heads a $1.3 billion company that sells coffee, tea,
canned drinks, and ice cream in supermarkets and more than 2,000
coffee bars around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz sees the Web as a key meeting place in the lifestyle of
the future, and he plans to be there. At the center of his strategy
is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will
feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale
women.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of
New York, which is designing such a portal. Details are sketchy,
but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a
seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Already 70 percent of Starbucks high-income customers are on the
Internet, Schultz noted, so he's got the right kind of upscale,
wired demographics for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of Starbucks' Internet strategy include investing
millions of dollars in chat-room developer Talk City in April and
the launch earlier this month of an online and in-store magazine,
Joe, in cooperation with Time Inc. A press release described Joe as
a new vehicle for ``conversation, community and culture'' allied
with the Starbucks brand.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem: coffee drinks aren't available on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers can't serve latte, at least not yet,'' noted retail
analyst Bonnie Kramer Tonneson of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Even coffee beans, which constitute a small minority of
Starbucks' sales, don't have much Net potential since Starbucks
operates physical shops on almost every corner, making access to
beans at least as convenient as at  &LR; www.starbucks. &LR;   &LR; com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So who does Starbucks turn to for a highly branded, well-known
merchant partner that can attract wealthy shoppers and generate
significant Web sales? Although Williams-Sonoma is late to the Web
_ it just launched its first full-scale site June 1 _ its
high-cachet brand name, big-ticket merchandise and loyal customer
base make it a logical partner.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams-Sonoma has its own Internet strategy in mind. Three
days after rebuffing the coffee-maker, Williams-Sonoma announced a
deal with CondeNet, the online magazine affiliate of Conde Nast
magazines. Williams-Sonoma expects to be a player in a portal/cable
TV business under development by CondeNet and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer is rolling out a full-scale Williams-Sonoma
kitchenware store this fall, adding to its new wedding registry at
 &LR; www. &LR;   &LR; wswedding.com &LR; . Next year it plans to launch two Pottery
Barn home furnishings sites, a registry and a store.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cohen, president of the consulting firm Strategic
Mindshare, likens Starbucks' lust for Williams-Sonoma to the
purchase of cataloger Fingerhut Companies Inc. by Federated
Department Stores Inc. earlier this year. Fingerhut's appeal was
its expertise in back-end order fulfillment, which Federated
intends to apply to its e-commerce businesses, said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma also boasts crack fulfillment systems, and
carries the additional value of well-known and highly regarded
brand names _ Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold Everything and
Chambers. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Conventional retailers like Williams-Sonoma ``already have
equity in consumers' minds, (and) trusted brands have everything to
do with the future of e-commerce,'' said Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The Starbucks overture raises questions about Williams-Sonoma's
future as an independent company. One reason it was considered a
desirable takeover candidate is that its stock is priced more like
that of a modest store and catalog merchant than a hot e-commerce
play.
</P>
<P>
   But that is starting to change. Shares have risen 20 percent
since news of the Starbucks bid became public, closing yesterday at
$35.81, up $1.81. Whether Williams-Sonoma is now being valued for
its e-commerce potential or as an acquisition target is hard to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tonneson believes the stock still has plenty of upside potential
since investors are just beginning to think of it as an e-commerce
play. Consequently, Williams-Sonoma executive stockholders are
unlikely to sell now and miss out on any future stock run-up, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give that away to someone else, when now they're really in
the game?'' Tonneson said.
