   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Starbucks Coffee Co. plan to acquire Pasqua
Coffee is leaving a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of some patrons
of the San Francisco-based coffeehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced
Tuesday that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount. Pasqua
has 56 outlets in the Los Angles, New York and San Francisco areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Tom Bennett, a construction worker who
was sipping a cup of joe at a Pasqua outlet in San Francisco. ``I
like the way it is and that's why I come in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sias, a supervisor with the Department of Public Health,
said he has been a Pasqua customer for five to six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, terrible,'' he said. Starbucks coffeehouses
``are already all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have no more choices soon,'' said Berkeley
resident Claire Greensfelder, 46, who said she avoids Starbucks at
all costs in favor of mom-and-pop cafes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care for Starbucks, and I won't go there,''
Greensfelder said. ``It's destruction of individual choice, and it
takes the fun out of it if every coffee shop is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Pasqua, Starbucks will inherit a small
chain that had $26 million in revenue last year, adding to an
empire that had sales of $1.3 billion by comparison. The transition
should be complete by February.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, with more than 1,700 stores in North America, wants
to add 400 more in the United States and Canada within the year. In
April, the chain paid about $81 million in stock for the Seattle
Coffee Co. in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the addition of the Pasqua locations, we're even more
confident that we'll meet our goal in continental North America,''
said Alan Gulick, a Starbucks spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Sheffield, who works at Pasqua shop in San Francisco,
said she learned about the sale from her sister, who works for
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they leave us alone because Pasqua is more
customer-oriented than Starbucks seems to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the San Francisco-based Spinelli Coffee Co. was
purchased by Tully's Coffee Corp., another Seattle company.
</P>
<P>
   Pasqua, which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks
banner, operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles
and New York, and has eight licensed airport locations in
California. In addition, the company has a coffee roastery in San
Francisco, three commissaries and two bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Pasqua co-founder Martin Kupferman acknowledged it had gotten
more difficult to compete with Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Starbucks, and nobody else is going to touch them,'' said
Kupferman, who added that he was satisfied with terms of the sale.
