<HEADLINE> Starbucks Expects Lower Profits </HEADLINE>

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. warned Wednesday that annual  
profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its 
non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet 
portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60  
cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late Wednesday 
predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the 
next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made after the markets closed. Starbucks'  
shares fell $10, or nearly 27 percent, in after-hours trading on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing the regular session at 
$37.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Calabrese, editor and analyst at Argus Research predicted  
the stock would rebound gradually Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain it won't hold there in the morning,'' Calabrese  
said. But he cautioned, ``I don't think it's going to climb up to 
where it closed today for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks' other  
businesses haven't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a 
conference call. He named the company's specialty food business and 
its North American partnership with Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz also cited $4 million in unbudgeted costs for developing  
the company's Internet strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in  
Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but 
that didn't happen, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said. While the  
company's North American retail profit margin is up 1 percent in 
fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998, Schultz said profits fell 
below internal estimates. In retail sales alone, Schultz said, 
revenue was expected to be $16 million less than initial internal 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever  
for the potential for significant profit growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will play a role in that growth.  
</P>
<P>
	To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will  
form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice 
president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web  
site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and 
home furnishings as well as coffee products and music. He also said 
the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the 
Internet site later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said  
the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at 
$100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's  
customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more 
than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
