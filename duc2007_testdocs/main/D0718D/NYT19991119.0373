 _ SF CHRON  
 Starbucks to Buy San Francisco Entertainment Retailer  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale
music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for
under $10 million.
<P>
   Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several
years and considers music an important part of how customers
experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a minor acquisition (for Starbucks), but it is a first
step toward fortifying the whole in-store and online experience,''
said Tonneson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closed in mid-October and Hear's staff has already
moved to Starbucks' offices in Seattle, said Don MacKinnon, Hear's
former chief executive, in a telephone interview yesterday.
MacKinnon's new title is vice president, music and entertainment,
for Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music stores are unusual in that they focus on educating
shoppers about music and introducing them to new artists. Listening
stations are arranged thematically; shoppers are allowed to unwrap
and listen to any CD in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MacKinnon told The Chronicle in September that he intended to
roll out 75 to 100 Hear Music stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, he said plans for new non-Starbucks locations are
on hold, although the five existing locations _ in Berkeley, San
Francisco, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago _ will remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Partnering with Starbucks was Hear's best option for going
national, MacKinnon said. It's the best place to find Hear's
upscale customer ``in the right mood, in great numbers and at a
time when they sort of taking a pause in their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks did not release terms of the deal other than to say
that it spent less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Thursday, Starbucks chief
executive Howard Schultz disclosed plans to install listening
stations in some Starbucks cafes, according to Andrew Barish, an
analyst with Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks will likely connect to a Hear Music Intranet that
contains music reviews and recommendations. The Intranet is
currently  &LR; used in a new Hear prototype store in San Francisco's
Metreon shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon said no decision has been made about how many stores
will include kiosks. ``There will be different solutions in
different stores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, 800 of Starbucks' 2,500 stores installed fixtures
holding branded Starbucks CDs, plus other selections chosen by the
Hear team, such as the popular Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, MacKinnon and his staff will produce all of
Starbucks' CDs. Music accounts for less than 1 percent of total
Starbucks sales, Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has installed a link from its home page,
www.starbucks.com, to Hear Music's site, www.hearmusic.com.
Starbucks is also promoting links with two other new Web partners,
Cooking.com and Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a mail-order wine retailer.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Starbucks announced an ambitious strategy of
creating a ``lifestyle portal'' of upscale brands on the Web. It
formed partnerships with several Web content providers and
attempted to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., which spurned the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But investors frowned on that strategy, sending Starbucks' stock
plummeting. Since then, Starbucks has scaled back those plans.
``Instead of an all-consuming focus for Howard Schultz it's more of
a sidebar,'' Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music, which was privately held, generated revenues of
between $5 million and $10 million in 1998. It was founded by
MacKinnon and two partners in Cambridge, Mass., in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hear was sold in 1992 to CML Group, which undertook an
unsuccessful rollout. MacKinnon and a partner bought it back from
CML for $371,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its five U.S. stores and the Starbucks deal, Hear
licenses its name and format to Chapters, a Canadian superstore
chain, which runs 12 in-store music shops under the Hear name.
