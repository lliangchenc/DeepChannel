   SEATTLE _ Starbucks Coffee Co. announced a new a consumer
products division for its specialty ice cream, bottled coffee
drinks and other products sold away from its own shops. It also
said it will share revenue with CARE from its first month's sale of
a new package of coffees from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new division will be headed by Paul Davis, 42.
Davis has spent 14 years at PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, most recently
as head of Hostess Frito-Lay Canada. He becomes president of
consumer products for Starbucks, and will report to Starbucks'
president and chief operating officer, Orin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said the move ``represents our
commitment to building a major consumer products business'' around
``an enduring global brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The new division will take over business that already brought in
$206 million last year, or almost 16 percent of the company's total
sales. Most of it has been joint ventures: the ice cream with
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola;
and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft
Foods Inc. The company has just introduced a line of premium
chocolates in its stores, but made no announcement about any other
channel of distibution.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz noted the company's success in extending the Starbucks
brand and said, ``We are in the early stages of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also continues in its commitment as a major donor to
CARE, for which it has helped to raise $1.4 million since 1991.
Tomorrow, it will begin offering a new package of of coffees from
Guatemala, Costa Rica and Brazil, and will donate $1 per package
sold through May 11. The money will be used to support community
organization in the highlands of Guatemala, as part of a ``civil
society'' project there; girls' education in Nyeri, Kenya, where it
has not been customary to send girls to school; and education in
hygiene and farming practices in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. All are
countries that grow coffee for Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   The new pack is also notable in that it is the first time
Starbucks has offered single-origin coffee from Brazil. Mary
Williams, senior vice president for coffee, said she had not been
impressed with the overall quality of coffee from Brazil, but that
it has been improving. She said this sample, a heavy-bodied,
low-acid variety called Ipanema Bourbon, represents the country's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks also said Monday its revenue was up 27 percent in the
five weeks ended March 28 compared with a year earlier, or 6
percent on a same-store basis. On March 28, the company had 2,192
stores. It had opened 309 in the previous half-year.
