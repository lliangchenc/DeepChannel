<HEADLINE> Pakistan Uses Nuclear Capability Peacefully: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "Pakistan has nuclear
capability, but has decided at the highest level not to use it for
non-peaceful purposes," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this
afternoon, he strongly refuted the report that Pakistan was
preparing for a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post daily quoted some US officials as saying
Wednesday that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first
underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such
issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say
that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its
security," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the Washington Post's story as
"speculative and based on faulty leaked intelligence reports."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has been in the vanguard locally and regionally to
advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as
the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have
fumbled because of India's negativism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The US government has also criticized India recently for
preparing for its second nuclear test.
