	   ``Pakistan is ... prepared to adhere to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty before this conference,'' Sharif told world leaders at
the U.N. General Assembly session.
	   ``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions
imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily
removed,'' Sharif said.
	   ``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan
will be lifted,'' he said.
	   But Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on
nuclear tests only so long as India did the same.
	   ``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review
its position,'' Sharif said.
	   Both India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last May,
drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban
treaty.
