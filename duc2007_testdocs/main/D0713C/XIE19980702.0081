<HEADLINE> Russia Calls on India, Pakistan to Join NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday repeated its call
to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry
said "Russia insists on immediate and unconditional accession" of
India and Pakistan to the treaty, and the revision of their
nuclear policies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 190 countries have joined the treaty, which took effect
in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995, he said. Russia
wanted the pact to be universal.
</P>
<P>
In a move that sparked global shock and concern, India launched
underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and triggered Pakistan
to follow suit late that month, despite the risk of bringing about
a nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition to the nuclear tests, Russia did not favor
sanctions against India and wanted to carry out military
cooperation with India if it respected Moscow's line on nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has developed and will continue to develop its military
cooperation with India within the framework of international norms
and national legislation," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Moscow would obviously watch Delhi's response to
Russia's line towards nuclear disarmament," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Alexei Yablokov, a well known Russian environmental expert,
told Interfax the NPT was, in effect, violated by Russia's plan to
supply India with nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Russia and India, on June 21, signed a deal supplementing the
Soviet-Indian agreement of 1988 on cooperation in construction of
a nuclear power station in Kudankulam, said Yablokov.
