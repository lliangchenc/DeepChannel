The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
The Israelis' activities raised suspicions, and when they returned, Cypriot officials obtained a search warrant for their temporary apartment, and said they had found cameras, maps, two scanners and tapes of Greek conversations between police or military officials.
A Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions, and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such admission.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
The Israelis have sold military equipment and provided training to the Turks, and the Turks have allowed Israeli military planes to fly over Turkish air space.
Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
