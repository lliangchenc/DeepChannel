The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.
The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the national library or, more precisely, in Congress's library and it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
The notion of putting the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones somewhere else is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and scholars.
Scores of Library of Congress librarians, the Library of Congress Professional Association, and Local 2910 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have howled in protest.
Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress American Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands of historical documents.
The numbers involved are huge : The Library of Congress, which has 117 million items in its archives, hopes to have 4 million items digitized and accessible on the World Wide Web by the turn of the century.
The committee expressed less concern over the library's ongoing efforts to make digital copies of items in its physical collection.
