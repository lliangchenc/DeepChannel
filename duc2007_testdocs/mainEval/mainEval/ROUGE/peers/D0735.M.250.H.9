While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as "threatened" may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.

Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast.
This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand
