Myanmar's military government has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday.
The military has arrested more than 500 members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, since May, party leaders said Wednesday.
The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
The All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles group, said the junta had arrested more than 300 students since June for campaigning for democracy.
``The ABSDF estimates that more than 900 political arrests have taken place since May, including MPs from all opposition parties, opposition party officials, students, Buddhist monks and other political activists,'' the group said.
A total of 26 members of various anti-government armed groups surrendered to the Myanmar government in March.
Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to be convened.
According to a latest official disclosure, a total of 15 anti-government ethnic armed groups have made peace with the government, leaving only one, the KNU, still in insurgency.
NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, 71, who has been imprisoned twice by Myanmar's military leaders, is a former defense minister, army commander in chief, Buddhist monk and lawyer.
