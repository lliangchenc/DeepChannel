Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, saying, "I cannot imagine that the economic summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not happened yet" Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early March.
On the part of Israel, it is still dissatisfied with what the Palestinians have done on fighting terrorism, declaring that more Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years since Oslo than in the 15 preceding years.
Since the deadline of Oslo Accords is approaching, analysts noted that the two sides have to rebuild their mutual trust as soon as possible and carry out all signed agreements seriously and swiftly.
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment.
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
In the last year and a quarter Netanyahu's government has tried to break Oslo.
