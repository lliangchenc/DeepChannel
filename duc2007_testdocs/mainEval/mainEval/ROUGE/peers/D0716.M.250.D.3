A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia (ERA) company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
Police have not said if they suspect a link between the attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it already operates inside the park.
Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
