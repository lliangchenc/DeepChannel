The New York Times Co. and Starbucks Coffee Co. said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times' advertising promotion of Starbucks.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
The agreement calls for The Times to be sold at all American Starbucks stores.
Some stores may also offer local newspapers and other national newspapers.
The Times will use its advertising resources to promote the products and retail outlets of Starbucks, which is based in Seattle.
There will also be a link between The New York Times' circulation Web site (www.homedelivery.nytimes.com) and the Starbucks Web site (www.starbucks.com).
