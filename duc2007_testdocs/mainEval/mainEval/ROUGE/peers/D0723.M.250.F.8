Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.
It's no coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Dianne Feinstein suddenly are being touted as women who can win high office in 2000 _ even though none has said she will be running for office.
One idea is to have NOW members show up at campaign events featuring Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley with placards that say "Democrats Deserve Dianne," and "Countdown to D-Day." Of the party's six female senators and 39 representatives, none comes close to matching Feinstein in stature or electability.
The issue of her husband's investments has dogged Feinstein since she was elected to the Senate in 1992.
Feinstein said the convention would shine a spotlight on the fact that California _ the largest state in the country with 34 million people _ has elected two women senators.
Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992 and both spoke at the convention that year.
Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to become governor.
Like Feinstein in the Senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for re-election _ two are leaving the House.
In the U.S. Senate there are only nine of them, but the speakers, including California Sens.
Barbara Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work
