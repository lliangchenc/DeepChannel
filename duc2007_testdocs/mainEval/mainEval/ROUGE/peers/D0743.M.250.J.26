Eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said they held out hopes that more people could be found alive.
Turks are struggling to recover from the massive, 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial heartland.
An Istanbul observatory reported that the quake registered 5.8 on the Richter scale.
Some 26,000 survivors of the Aug. 17, 1999, quake that devastated Turkey's industrial heartland are living in tent cities.
The quake virtually leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western Turkey.
The government has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake, which seismologists warn could happen at any time.
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related diseases surpassed 4,100.
Together, the two quakes lasted about 45 seconds at 3 a.m.
Barka told the private NTV television station.
Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily : By night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had been recovered.
Foreign help is especially vital because early rescue efforts by the Turkish authorities have been plagued by inexperience, poor organization and lack of supplies.
In some stricken towns arrived foreigners found no organized rescue effort under way and took charge themselves, directing battalions of eager volunteers.
The rescue effort is a fiasco, one Istanbul newspaper asserted.
