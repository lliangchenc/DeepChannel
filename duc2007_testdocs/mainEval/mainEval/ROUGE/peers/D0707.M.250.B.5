ANKARA, February 27 - Turkey today welcomed the European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite Greek efforts to block it.
According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between Turkey and Greece.
The statement added that Greece, despite its attempts, was unable to get the support of the other 14 European Union members in getting a statement that would express solidarity with Greece and condemn Turkey.
Turkey said Wednesday it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week.
Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with Greece.
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides.
WASHINGTON, March 11 - The U.S. government said today that the European Union should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Some EU members insisted that Turkey is an Asian nation, not European.
