A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
CANBERRA, April 15 - The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years.
Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
