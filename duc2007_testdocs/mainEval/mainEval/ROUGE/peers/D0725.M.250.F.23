The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as attempting to learn what local military and technological capability Iran had developed.
Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
He [Hans Blix] said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes.
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons, and all its atomic programs are based on "peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical, agricultural and energy-generation purposes" and "within the framework of the internationally-recognized absolute rights of any country."
