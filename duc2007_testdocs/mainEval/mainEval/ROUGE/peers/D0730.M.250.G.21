In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.
Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act ``succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court'' because the statute does not give the president new veto authority, Scalia said.What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending is technically different.
The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.
Scalia, writing for the dissenters, argued that the true intent of the line-item veto law was misread by the court majority.
``The title...designed to simplify... or perhaps merely comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court,'' he said.
The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch.
The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before the end of the term in late June or early July.
