The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site.
Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy.
The music industry has some fresh ammunition in its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has cut into music sales.
Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in trading copyrighted music.
In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter the music-swapping site from their computer networks.
