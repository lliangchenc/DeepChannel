WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.
``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office,'' Feinstein said.
Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an alternative to conviction.
Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate.
The Democratic senator said Thursday that she will seek re-election in 2000, and will begin the effort later this month with a fund-raiser in San Francisco.
``The reason I didn't run for governor is that I want to continue in the Senate,'' Feinstein said Thursday in an interview.
Feinstein is frequently mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000.
