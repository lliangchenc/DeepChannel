Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of decisions Kennedy made that night--flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an airplane with a foot injury--have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah, Mass.
NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
The less-than-perfect visibility conditions--known in flying parlance as ``marginal VFR (visual flight rules),'' made Kennedy's trip more challenging than normal, agreed Warren Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group.
Several hours later, Navy divers in heavy-duty gear adjusted the crumpled wreckage and found the passengers on his flight through black haze last Friday night--his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law, Lauren G. Bessette.
That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
