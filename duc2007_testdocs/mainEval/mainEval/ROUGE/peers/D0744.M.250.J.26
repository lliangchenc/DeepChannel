The U.S. organic industry continues to see unprecedented growth.
The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and a fear of genetically engineered food.
When the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations.
The government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label organic for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics.
The growth of organic food from a fringe movement to a $5 billion nationwide industry is based mostly on trust.
The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades.

Stores are selling meats and poultry products carrying organic labels, which the Agriculture Department approved.
An entire industry has sprung up to supply organic nutrition and holistic care to pets.
All food in this country must meet the same high standards of safety, regardless of their classification, Glickman said.
