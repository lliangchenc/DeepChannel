``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die?
Matthew Shepard is just one more grim statistic.
Matthew Shepard, 21, died early Monday after being in a coma for nearly a week.
McKinney is charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery.
McKinney expressed regret for his role in the murder, which spurred nationwide rallies for legislation against hate crimes.
And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of gay people as subhuman.
On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.
Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in legislatures around the country this year on issues important to gays and lesbians.
Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death penalty.
Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago.
Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes.
Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
The bill got the support from some of the most conservative Republicans, who saw the legislation as tough on crime.
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper Texas of James Byrd a 49-year-old black man
