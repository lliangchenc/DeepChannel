Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level UN committee was told Wednesday.
The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
A second uranium mine is almost certain to be operating inside Australia's Kakadu World Heritage Area by 2000 after Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill said there was no environmental reason why it could not go ahead.
She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years.
It expects the mine to add US dlrs 37 billion (Australian dollars 62 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
