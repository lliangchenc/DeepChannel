Lewinsky : A little bit, but for me, the point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way to cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never disclosed that to the president.
