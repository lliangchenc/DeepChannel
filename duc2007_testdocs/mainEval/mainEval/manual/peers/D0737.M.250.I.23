Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years.  What is needed now, according to both oceanographers and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and in the technology of deep marine exploration.

Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships -- the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic.  Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to find more ancient wrecks along the same path.

Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch as it takes its pictures.

After much research Chinese engineers have developed a robot which can operate 6,000 meters underwater and will be used in such deep-sea mining.  The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record, measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water conditions and search for missing objects while automatically recording data, according to the report.
