 News of the settlement came as reports that the company is close to settling most of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against it for at least $3 billion. The lawsuit asserts that American Home Products Corp. underreported the instances of pulmonary hypertension as a result of using fenfluramine, the fen part of the drug combination. Almost six million Americans took the diet drug combination. The drug's maker, American Home Products, and plaintiffs attorneys who worked out the settlement favor its approval. Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit. A 12-member jury was seated to hear the case, filed by Sandra Moore against American Home Products Corp., the parent of pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. American Home Products sold the fen half of the combination under the brand name Pondimin, and made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. Madison, N.J.-based American Home made fenfluramine, the fen in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. Evidence linking the fen half of the drug duo with sometimes deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market. Interneuron is facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux. Lawyers familiar with litigation over the diet drugs have said several fen-phen death cases in the country have been settled for about $4 million to $5 million each. 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal.
