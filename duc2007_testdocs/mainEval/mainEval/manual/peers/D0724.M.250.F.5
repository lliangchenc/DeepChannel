Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday. Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr. William H. Dietz, director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional problems. An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity. According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs nearly $100 billion annually. That includes costs for weight loss treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by obesity. Scientists have discovered another genetic flaw that seems to raise the risk of obesity. Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density declines with age.
