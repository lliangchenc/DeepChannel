Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in 1996. Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community. A senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. The Damascus-based Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) today denounced Israel's policy of settlement, describing it as a serious challenge to the foundations and principles of the Mideast peace process. The Oslo Accords, signed by Netanyahu's predecessor, late Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of "land-for-peace." Otherwise, Netanyahu pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. In an interview with the Egyptian TV program "Beit Al Arab" broadcast today, Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted that he ignores the Oslo accords.
