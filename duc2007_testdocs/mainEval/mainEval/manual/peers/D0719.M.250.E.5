Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed to a rise in crime and violence. PARIS, January 3 - The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc unemployment aid package. She also promised to continue holding talks with unions and anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the government in favor of jobless people. Meanwhile, the government ordered the local governments in prefectures to solve case by case the job problems of people living in distress, and asked them to maintain "emergency cells"responsible for tackling unemployment. Moreover, the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent, or 333,600 people, from December 1998 to December 1999. In Paris, about 400 people occupied the headquarters of French insurance firm AXA to protest against poverty and homelessness in general, unfurling a banner reading"War on Poverty". Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
