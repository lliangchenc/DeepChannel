The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) failed to intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. U.S. Defense Department said Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile defense system despite five consecutive test failures. 

The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. It could take years before scientists and the defense industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, intercontinental missile. 

The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads. The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles, ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching. 

Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack. The development of the two missile defense systems will meet the need for countering potential short-range missile threats against the United States. The Pentagon should not deploy a national missile defense system until 2008. The U.S. Congress has insisted that the United States should develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty, national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in planning for such a system anyway. Britain
