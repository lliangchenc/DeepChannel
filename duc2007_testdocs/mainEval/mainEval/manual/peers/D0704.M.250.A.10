In response to a memorandum by Amnesty International on human rights situation in Kenya, the Kenyan leader told the visiting Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane that his government appreciated constructive criticism made in good faith. The concerns raised in the memorandum cover a range of issues including constitutional reform, ordinary legislative reform and executive administration of laws. Referring to the constitutional reforms, the vice-president said that after the general elections a commission would be appointed to review the Kenya constitution. Kenya reminded ai that it had machinery and a working system of handling matters such as human rights violations and would continue to address itself to cases of human rights violations. The human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused German police of racism in a report issued here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995. Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such complaints. The Rwandan government has expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country.
