Hussein tried to calm concerns in Israel that Pakistan might share its capabilities and technology with other Muslim states. The Clinton administration expressed new worry over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. But in Washington and Israel, the test caused serious concern. South Africa, a former emerging nuclear power, stopped its nuclear program before reaching weapon capacity. Iraq's nuclear weapons program has been largely destroyed. The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not its intentions, officials said. Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year u.n. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction. People in Israel are getting fairly perplexing bits of news about missile proliferation in their region. But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself could be in Iran's sights. The tests in south Asia triggered serious concern about the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East region. Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability. Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the npt states under the Iaea control could not cause damage to any other country. The two sides proposed that the countries of the region should refrain from developing, producing, testing and acquiring nuclear weapons and from deploying them on their territory.
