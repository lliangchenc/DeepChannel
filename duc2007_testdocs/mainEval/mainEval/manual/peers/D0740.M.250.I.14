Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world. The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week. A Swiss-English balloon team soared over Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to travel nonstop around the world. A Swiss-Belgian team took off from a lake-side mountain in the Swiss Alps Sunday in the latest bid to balloon non-stop around the world, according to reports from Chateau D'oex, Switzerland. The capsule that carried balloonists on the first nonstop hot air trip around the globe went on permanent display Thursday in the National Air and Space Museum, next to the Wright brothers' plane and the craft that carried man to the moon. The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that they will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon. Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight. The round world trip is expected to take about two weeks.
