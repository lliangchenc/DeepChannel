Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise money for her legal fees. A Maryland grand jury investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday, demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week, one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday. U.S. House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial. Linda Tripp, whose taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky sparked President Clinton's impeachment crisis, has agreed to interviews with NBC's "Today" show and CNN's "Larry King Live." Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony. A prosecutor does not have to release a summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest court has ruled. Starr is investigating whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
