Out of the pupils enrolled in Standard One, only 47 percent complete the primary education; out of these, only 17 percent survive to complete the secondary schooling, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Wilfred Kimalat said Tuesday.
He said that only seven percent of high-school graduates are lucky enough to go to public universities, which means that only 1.2 percent of those who begin the education cycle make it to university.
The project is one of the largest projects ever undertaken by the ODA in the primary education sub-sector throughout the world, the minister stated.
During the phase one already completed, the ODA provided more than seven million Dollars to buy textbooks and science equipment for primary schools in arid and semi-arid areas.
The phase two is aimed at improving the quality of primary education including the training of primary school head teachers throughout the east African country.
Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult.
