The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for action on a range of international humanitarian issues including curbing small arms.
