Washington (AP) -- the Clinton administration has selected Alaska as the likely first site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile defense network.  The Pentagon is still working on an estimate, but its most recent estimate last spring put the tally at $36 billion for a system with 100 missile interceptors at a single site, in Alaska.  Washington (AP) -- the Pentagon conducted two tests Thursday of important elements of the proposed national missile defense system in preparation for another attempt to shoot down a target in space.  Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age "national missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack.  During the research, Boeing will design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for missile launch detection and communications.  Washington, May 12 (Xinhua) -- the Pentagon's fifth missile Defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the Defense Department said in a statement.  The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, was done at White Sands missile range, New Mexico.  Washington, May 25 (Xinhua) -- the U.S. Army scratched Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a problem with the one that was to serve as its target.  The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's dive to develop a National missile Defense (NMD) system.
