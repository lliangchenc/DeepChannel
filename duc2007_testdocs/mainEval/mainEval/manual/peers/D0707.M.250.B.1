ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's leading human rights activist was released from prison Saturday and said he hoped to be the last person jailed in Turkey under laws curbing freedom of expression. 

Akin Birdal, former president of the independent Human Rights Association, served 10 months in prison. He was convicted of inciting racial hatred for urging an end to Turkey's 16-year war against Kurdish rebels in the largely Kurdish southeast. 

''My hope and wish is to be the last person imprisoned because of writing and voicing ideas,'' Birdal said outside an Ankara prison where he was greeted by 100 human rights activists. 

Birdal said Turkey had not made concrete steps to improve its human rights record. 

''Don't the Turkish people deserve democratization?'' he asked. 

Turkey is often criticized for its poor human rights record. Europe and the United States have called on Turkey to crack down on torture in police stations and reform its laws curbing freedom. 

Birdal, 51, is still recovering from an assassination attempt in May 1998, when two assailants shot him six times. Eleven members of a far-right nationalist group were convicted and sentenced in December 1998 to up to 19 months in prison for attempted murder. 

He was released for health reasons last year after serving three months, but was jailed again in March. 

Both the European Union and the United States criticized Turkey for jailing Birdal.
