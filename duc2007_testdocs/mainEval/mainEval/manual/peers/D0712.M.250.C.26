 The death sentence was meant to be carried out. The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence. The Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference here that Iran would not send anyone to kill Rushdie. More half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament signed a letter saying the death edict against Rushdie stands. A semi-government foundation in Iran raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million. It seems that this has been done in Iran with consensus. The Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries. Rushdie has made many overseas trips. The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie. After Khomeini announced the sentence on Feb. 14, claiming Rushdie had blasphemed Islam in The Satanic Verses, the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly a decade in hiding under police protection.
