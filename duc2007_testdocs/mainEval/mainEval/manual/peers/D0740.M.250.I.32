Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.

Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.

Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.

Their Cable and Wireless balloon, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft.

Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Brian Jones climbed out of the hi-tech gondola of the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to break off some of the icicles with an ice pick on Thursday.

The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week.

Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.

The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.

Parts of the balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
