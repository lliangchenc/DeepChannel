The Addis Ababa Regional Water and Sewerage Authority announced that the shortage of potable water in the capital city of Ethiopia will be solved in the last quarter of this year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Friday called upon the people to save water at a time when the water shortage problem has affected various states including the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand, Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj. The well will help deal with the severe water shortage problem in Fuping county and help with the search for new water sources in water-short northwest China. The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days, experts said. They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage. Mahathir said the water problem was related to the change in the climatic situation in Malaysia and the most effective way was for everyone to save water and be thrifty. The official said that the main reason for the water shortage was inadequate government investment in building water supply projects.
