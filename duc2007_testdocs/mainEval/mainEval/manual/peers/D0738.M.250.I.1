LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Peruvian government fined Latin America's largest gold mine $500,000 for a mercury spill in June that poisoned dozens of Andean villagers. 

The fine was announced Tuesday in a legal notice in the government's official newspaper, El Peruano. 

Officials from the Yanacocha gold mine had already pledged to pay all costs for medical treatment and environmental cleanup. Company officials last month cited 70 confirmed cases of mercury contamination. 

A local midwife was the only person to fall gravely ill, lapsing into a coma, said Andres Vargas, associate director of the Regional Hospital of Cajamarca, 350 miles north of the capital, Lima. 

On June 2, a truck carrying mercury from the Yanacocha gold mine spilled about 3 gallons of the toxic liquid metal in the village of Choropampa, according to the Newmont Mining Company of Denver, which has a 51.4 percent stake in the operation. 

The mercury leaked onto a road near the village, 53 miles southwest of the mine, while it was being transported by a private trucking firm, the company said. 

The mercury, a byproduct of the mining operation, is sold to a Lima-based firm that uses it for medical equipment.
