ISLAMABAD, June 14 - Water shortage in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad is expected to deteriorate as water reservoir can meet demand of the consumers just for 12 days. The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days, experts said. Failing to cope with the water shortage, the Capital Development Authority has resorted to further reduction in water supply to the residents who are already complaining of non-availability of the commodity. Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ), told the symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects, which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of water resources. BEIRUT, December 10 - A Lebanese official has warned that his country is suffering an annual water shortage of more than 1 billion cubic meters, the Daily Star reported Friday. Other scientists argued that while increasing supply will reduce the water deficit, an efficient water management scheme is also needed to help meet the demand. Almost 50 percent of the diseases posing a threat to children's lives are caused by the lack of clean water.
