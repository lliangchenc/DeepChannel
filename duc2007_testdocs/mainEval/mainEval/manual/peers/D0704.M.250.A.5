Amnesty International on Friday demanded a government probe into what it said were unauthorized detention camps run by two armed Tamil groups opposed to the secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels. In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the London-based human rights organization said the two groups were helping Sri Lanka's military fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, known as the LTTE. Sri Lanka's government has introduced several measures to safeguard the welfare of detainees, but Amnesty International said the measures are enforced poorly, if at all. Fourteen of his associates have also been detained, Amnesty International said. London-based human rights group Amnesty International accused the South Korean government Saturday of trying to control what was supposed to be an independent national human rights commission. The Thailand office of Amnesty International announced Monday that three publications and two journalists have won its 1998 Journalism Award for Human Rights.
