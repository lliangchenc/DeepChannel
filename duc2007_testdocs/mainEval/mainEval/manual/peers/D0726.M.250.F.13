Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization, aides to the vice president. 
Gore is tapping into a network of loyal Democratic campaign donors whose contributions to the Clinton-Gore ticket and the Democratic Party in 1992 and 1996 enabled Democrats to mount the most expensive presidential campaign in American history. 
Gore on Saturday took his presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House. 
Gore, criticized for not having enough women in his inner circle, has hired a veteran female strategist to be his deputy campaign manager for his 2000 presidential bid. 
His 2000 campaign has appointed a campaign pro with local Washington connections as its political director. 
Gore named a veteran of the Clinton-Gore presidential campaigns to be his campaign press secretary. 
Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched Ganamos con Gore (We win with Gore), a nationwide effort to build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice president Tuesday. 
Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide. 
The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
