The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect on Jan. 12, to be stable. All use the French franc as their currency. Italy was designated to begin negotiations with San Marino and the Vatican over their use and eventual issuance of euro currency. The government has said it will keep the currency board in place until the country is in a position to adopt the euro as its own currency. The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released today that it has decided on two themes for the new currency: history of European civilization and abstract or concrete paintings. The early attribution of the currency code will help economic agents, in particular financial institutions, in their preparatory work for the introduction of the single currency. As a result, they possibly wouldn't be able to do transactions in Euro from the day it takes effect. In response to a question concerning the issue at today's news conference, Zhu said the introduction of the Euro is expected to stimulate European integration, help establish a more balanced world financial system and exert influence on the world's economy and politics. The single currency and employment were among the top three topics for which more information is desired by the respondents to a recent eu questionnaire. The other top topic is the rights for being a European citizen. The Euro will be launched on 1, 1999.
