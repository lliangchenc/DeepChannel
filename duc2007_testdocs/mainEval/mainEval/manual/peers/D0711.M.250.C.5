Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct to breaking up the company. Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that Microsoft would appeal. Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices. At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company. Gore received an icy reception when he visited the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., last November. He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law. Back in Seattle, Washington state, where Microsoft is based, the company fired off five upbeat, product-oriented press releases and other announcements. Local press reports said that attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways to break up the company as a method to curb anticompetitive practices. One reported option would be to split the company into two or three parts, each selling separate products, such as the Windows operating system and Internet content.
