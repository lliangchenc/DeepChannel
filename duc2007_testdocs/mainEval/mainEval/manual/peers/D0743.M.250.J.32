Figures available Saturday on the earthquake that struck Turkey early Tuesday.

The earthquake that struck western Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a leading geologist said Sunday.

Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago as a particularly dangerous one.

Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once every two years.

Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997.

A strong tremor shook already devastated towns in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, bringing several buildings crashing down and causing at least one death.

At least seven people died Monday and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.

The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Turkey has risen to 7,085, with 33,559 injured, the government crisis center said early Friday, two days after the quake hit the northwestern part of the country.

Kocaeli is the most seriously devastated province after the monster quake hit the western Turkey.

The death toll in the monster earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting.

Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4 killer quake struck western Turkey.
