Angelina Jolie's win for best supporting actress for her role in ''Girl, Interrupted'' came 21 years after father Jon Voight was awarded best actor for ''Coming Home.''

Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes, for the title role in the HBO movie ''Gia,'' about a supermodel who died of AIDS; for the TV movie ''George Wallace''; and for last year's theatrical film ''Girl, Interrupted.''  Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for ``Gia,'' which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie.  

When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie.

She [Angelina Jolie] has stolen every movie she [Angelina Jolie] has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart.''  Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's ``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS.  But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles _ Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
