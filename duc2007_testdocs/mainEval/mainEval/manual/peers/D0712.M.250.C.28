On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
A foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York.
The European Union on Monday welcomed a move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini ...caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
