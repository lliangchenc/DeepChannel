The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. France calls on both India and Pakistan not to conduct any more nuclear tests but to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and join talks on the banning of production of fissile materials that can be used to produce nuclear arms, said the communique. In reaction to Pakistan's nuclear tests, Egypt Thursday underscored the need to make the Middle East a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Politicians from Europe and South America continue to criticize India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests, urging the two South Asian countries to abandon plans for future tests. Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and denying nuclear status to the two rivals. Members of the Organization of American States (OAS) Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to conduct no more nuclear tests similar to those they carried out last month. A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday said that the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan were of concern for regional and global stability and security. The resolution said that the tests not only violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but also threatened peace and stability in South Asia.
