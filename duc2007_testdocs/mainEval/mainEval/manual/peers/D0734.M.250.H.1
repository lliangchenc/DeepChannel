Acupuncture appears to help some cocaine addicts escape their dependence on the drug, according to a report published Tuesday by researchers at Yale University. 

Experts on drug abuse say cocaine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of drug dependency to treat. And while many treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time, usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been inconclusive. 

In the Yale study, 53.8 percent of the subjects who had needles inserted in four acupuncture ``zones'' in the ear five times a week tested free of cocaine at the end of the eight-week study period. In comparison, 23.5 percent of control subjects given ``sham'' acupuncture treatments and 9.1 percent of subjects who watched relaxation videos tested free of the drug during the final week of the study. 

The report appears in the August issue of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine. 

The study involved 82 men and women in the New Haven area who were addicted to both heroin and cocaine. They were receiving methadone treatment for the heroin addiction but were still using cocaine regularly. 

Thirty of the subjects, however, were dropped from the study after missing sessions. 

The researchers called the findings promising but cautioned that the study was relatively small and that more research needed to be done to confirm the results.
