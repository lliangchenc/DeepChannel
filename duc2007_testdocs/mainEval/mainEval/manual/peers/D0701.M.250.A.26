Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, to ask what East Peoria could do. The notice was the first indication that the lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, may drive the group out of Idaho. In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound 1998. Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization in Montgomery, Ala., advanced his case in federal court, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks or offered distinctly inferior services for the same prices that they charged whites. The Keenans attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award more than $11 million in punitive damages. So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical. In the process of creating a white homeland, the founder of the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, Butler has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism.
