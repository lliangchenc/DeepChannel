The quake's center near the town of Izmit was on a stretch of the North Anatolian fault where the MIT team, working with scientists from Turkish universities and the nation's science foundation, ``marked it two years ago as an area to be watched closely,'' said M. Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in Turkey since 1971. From the streets to government offices, earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease. Over 10,000 people are estimated to be still trapped in the ruins of the destroyed buildings and houses in the stricken provinces of Istanbul, Kocaeli (Izmit), Sakarya (Adapazari), Yalova, Bursa, Bolu, Eskisehir, Zonguldak, and Tekirdag. In the scientific article, two U.S. Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault, within the next 30 years. More than 1,000 relief workers from 19 countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations. The Goodyear plant in Izmit was built with steel walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager
