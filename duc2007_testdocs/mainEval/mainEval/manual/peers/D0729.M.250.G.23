More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his trackers.  The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta bombings.

Authorities did not discount a possible connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing Rudolph on Sunday.  Agents have said they want to question Rudolph in those bombings and that they are in no hurry to charge him [Eric Robert Rudolph] in the Atlanta cases, because they have a warrant for him in the Jan. 29 bombing in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.  During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him [Eric Robert Rudolph] with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub.
