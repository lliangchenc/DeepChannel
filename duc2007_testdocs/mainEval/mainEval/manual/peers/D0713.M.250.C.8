In Luxembourg, Javier Solana, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said the alliance would urge India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint and to respect the international non-proliferation norms and the CTBT.
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them discriminatory.
The spokesman warned that in the absence of an all-encompassing program for comprehensive nuclear disarmament, the status and future of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would face great uncertainty.
The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
