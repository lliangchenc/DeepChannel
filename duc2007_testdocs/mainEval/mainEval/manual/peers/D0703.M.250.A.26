The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank does not plans to encourage the use of the euro as a reserve currency, speaking at a conference in Berlin. The euro will be adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15 countries on New Year's Day, but willn't go into circulation on the streets until 2002. A number of countries are planning to hold the euro as part of their foreign currency reserves, the magazine quoted European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg as saying. Citibank, the world's largest foreign exchange operator, and ABN-AMRO said that they had planned to quote prices in the euro for their clients starting next. Lending giants in Britain have put detailed plans in place for financial life in the country. Italy and France have adopted the euro, as the European Union's new single currency is known. That leaves these various tiny places, all non-members of the EU, without a money of their own unless they make special arrangements to adopt the euro. The ministers ruled that San Marino, the Vatican and Monaco will be entitled to use the euro as their official currency, but they will not be allowed to issue any banknotes or coins unless they agreed to conditions imposed by the EU.
