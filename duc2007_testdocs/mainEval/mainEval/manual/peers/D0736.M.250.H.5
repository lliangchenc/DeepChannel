LONDON - Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime television - especially rival Jerry Springer's show - and is ready to bail out of her long-running show. Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of her current contract. Gore's Republican rival George W. Bush is scheduled to appear on September 19 on Winfrey's show, which reaches 22 million viewers weekly. Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children. And, somehow, talk just doesn't seem to fit this show any more. Call it a daily chakra show. Winfrey has reinvented herself, her show, her mission, her set, her theme song ( she sings it herself ). LOS ANGELES - After winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime achievement award, Oprah Winfrey is taking herself out of the running for best talk show host at this year's ceremony. NEW YORK - Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is starting a magazine next spring with the magazine publisher Hearst Corp.
