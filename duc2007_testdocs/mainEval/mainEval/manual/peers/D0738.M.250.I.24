Caracas, Venezuela (AP)--Indians clad in loincloths and smeared with warpaint on Thursday protested President Hugo Chavez's failure to halt gold mining in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests. Peru is the world's 12th biggest gold producer and second in South America after Brazil. It totals 700 million dollars a year right now and is expected to increase to 1.2 billion in the next few years, said the chairman of the gold committee of the National Mining and Petroleum Society. The sources forecast that gold output in Peru will be more than 65 tons in 1996 due to an investment of 26 million dollars in gold projects in the San Jose de Yanacocha and Retamas zones. 

Private mines were estimated to produce 3.2 million metric tons of refined copper, with the total production for the country reaching 4.7 million metric tons. Botswana has the world's largest mine with a production of 11.4 million karats. 

The Peruvian government fined Latin America's largest gold mine $500,000 for a mercury spill in June that poisoned dozens of Andean villagers. The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America. Environmentalists say the companies will increase damage to the forests. 

This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production. In the first four months this year, the mining production grew by 5.7 percent from a year
