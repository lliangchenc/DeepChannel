SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian   uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge  tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman  Environmental Prize.  

The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize   efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world.  

``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make   a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards.  ``You don't need a special education, special training or a special  background to help save the earth.''  

The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed   mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the  world's richest untapped uranium bodies. The government-approved  mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu  National Park.  

Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing   following a protest against the mine. Later, Katona urged a United  Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an  attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the  land for centuries.  

Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team   in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that  allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging  companies.  

``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of   individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few  private companies,'' Nguiffo said.
