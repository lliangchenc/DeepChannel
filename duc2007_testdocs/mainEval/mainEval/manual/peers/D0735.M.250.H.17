The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said, in November 1998. Slipping into the kind of harsh language that often has surrounded the wolf program, the association called the query "Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised reintroduction program." Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter -- perhaps as many as 17. In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. A wolf would need more. Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program. Even wolves are having problems. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt called a decision last week by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "a ringing endorsement of our wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho." Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning the reintroduction of wolves.
