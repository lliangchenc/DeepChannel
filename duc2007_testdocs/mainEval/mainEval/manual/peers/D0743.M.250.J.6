Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes elsewhere.
The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said.
``The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
The aftershock occurred at 17:30 local time (14:30 GMT), but no serious damage or injuries from the jolt have been reported.
The epicenter of the aftershock was about 130 kilometers about east of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey in the early hours of August 17.
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Shelton, who was in Turkey when the earthquake took place last night, had offered helicopters, tents and blankets from U.S. bases there.
Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Marc Grossman said a 70-member search-and-rescue team was expected to leave for the worst-hit city, Izmit, southeast of Istanbul.
Another team of eight disaster experts was being sent to Istanbul to help the Turkish authorities coordinate rescue work, Grossman said.
Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.
