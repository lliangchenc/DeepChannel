The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. on the eve of the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict.

The 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said.
