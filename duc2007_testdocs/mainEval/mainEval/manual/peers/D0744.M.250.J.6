The national standard will establish clear labeling criteria so consumers know exactly what they are buying.
Among other rules, the regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled ``organic.'' Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed will also be banned.
The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier for organic farmers to export their products because international trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather than multiple state and private standards.
1998: Organic farmers, processors, marketers, chefs and consumers send more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw a proposal to allow food to be labeled ``organic'' even if it is irradiated to kill germs, genetically engineered, or fertilized with treated sewage sludge.
The USDA continues to work on guidelines to have a national standard for ``organic'' food.

Katherine DiMatteo, the executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must be followed for safety.
Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7.'' His real goal, he said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically,'' he said.
